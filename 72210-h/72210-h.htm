</div>


<p>On the strength of his increase of income,
Mr. Holroyd purchased two ponies, and a
cart (and this cart, it was noted, had a
ladies’ step). He had long admired a
certain empty bungalow with a large
garden, and rose-screened verandah.
More than once he had inspected the
interior, and at last he boldly gave
orders to the landlord to have the garden
put in order, the hedges clipped, and the
rooms matted. When it became noised
abroad that George Holroyd had been
seen looking over a large double house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
that he had ordered a dinner-service, and
a piano, the truth could be no longer
concealed, he was going to be married!
This was a fine piece of news for
Mangobad. The men congratulated him
somewhat sadly but the ladies made up
for them in fervour, and were all on
the <i>qui vive</i> to know what the bride
would be like. Captain La Touche, being
searchingly cross-questioned, was able to
gratify them with a few particulars
respecting her. She was young—only
nineteen—Irish, and pretty, and, as far
as he could make out, she would be an
agreeable addition to their circle. Mr.
Holroyd was not the least bashful in
accepting their good wishes, and seemed
anxious to bespeak their friendship for
his future wife. She was so young and
inexperienced, he declared—quite a child
in many ways, and only hitherto accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
to a very quiet country life. He
was exceedingly grateful for any suggestions
offered by notable housekeepers and
a great deal of advice was placed ungrudgingly
at his service. The Judge’s
wife engaged a cook, khansamah, and
ayah; the Chaplain’s sister superintended
the purchase of lamps and kitchen utensils,
the Colonel’s two daughters chose furniture
for the drawing-room, and went
over the rooms and discussed arrangements
and ornamentation with zeal.</p>

<p>All at once the community were electrified
to hear that Mr. Holroyd had
suddenly changed his mind about what
was called the “garden” bungalow, and
was going into the two-storeyed one,
which had so long stood empty—the
bungalow in which the last tenant, Major
Bagshawe, had cut his throat. What
was the reason of such an extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
freak? Why exchange a modern, well-built
house, with a cheerful aspect, for
a gloomy tumble-down mansion—certainly
more imposing, and standing in
quite a park-like enclosure, but which
had been abandoned to rats and ghosts
for years. No one knew the motive for
this strange proceeding—not even Captain
La Touche.</p>

<p>A few days before “this mysterious
caprice of George Holroyd’s,” the long
desired mail had been received—the mail
which was to bring him Betty’s answer
in her own handwriting, instead of that
of the telegraph Baboo. The night before
it was delivered in Mangobad, he could
scarcely close his eyes. He was astir
by daybreak, and watching for the post
peon long before that worthy began his
rounds. Here he came in sight at last,
and with a good plump packet of letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
in his hand. George almost tore them
from him, and then hurried into his room
to read them in solitude, where no bearer
with tea, or sweeper with broom, dared
disturb him. There was one from his
mother, one from his lawyer, one from
Mrs. Redmond, one from Belle, but
where was Betty’s? He turned them
over very carefully, and then ran out
after the dakwalla. “Hullo! Stop!
Hold on!” he shouted (in Hindustani of
course), “you have another letter for me.”</p>

<p>The man halted and showed his wallet;
there was nothing else addressed to Mr.
Holroyd, no, not even a trade circular.
“There must be some mistake,” he muttered
to himself, as he slowly retraced
his steps. Could she have missed the
mail? He must only content himself
with Mrs. Redmond’s epistle for the
present, and, happy thought, that thrifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
old lady’s effusion might contain Betty’s
letter after all! Alas, no, there was
only one sheet of paper within the
envelope, and this is what it said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Holroyd</span>,—Your letter and
enclosure reached me by the last mail,
and I am rather concerned as to how to
reply to it, for I have taken a step that
will surprise you and which you may
never forgive—I have given your offer of
marriage to my daughter Belle.”</p>
</div>

<p>A rush of blood came suddenly to
George Holroyd’s ears, the paper seemed
to swim before him; he threw it down
on the table, and placing both hands to
his head, exclaimed aloud:</p>

<p>“I must be going mad! Either that,
or she is writing from a lunatic asylum!”</p>

<p>After a moment’s pause, he once more
snatched up the letter, and read on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There was nothing in your note that
did not equally apply to her, and Belle
is <i>so</i> fond of you, and you paid her such
marked attention, that if you were to
marry Betty she would lose her reason—or
break her heart.</p>

<p>“India has always been her dream,
and, with you and India combined, her
happiness is assured, and I may tell you
frankly, that this is all that I now care
for. You will think me a very wicked,
unprincipled old woman, but I have your
interests at heart, as well as Belle’s, and,
though I shall not live to know it, you
will approve of my conduct <i>yet</i>. I am
dying by inches. I may not see another
summer, and I obey the most natural of all
instincts in providing (when I can) for my
own child. Even if you execrate me, I can
endure your hatred, for I shall be supported
by the conviction, that I have done well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Belle, beautiful, animated, and accustomed
to the best military society, is the
beau ideal of an officer’s wife, and will
be in a congenial sphere—your credit and
your comfort. Betty—a simple, little,
awkward girl, with no ideas beyond
horses and dogs and flowers—is cut out
for the position <i>she</i> is about to fill; as
the wife of a wealthy country gentleman,
she can make herself happy in her own
land, she is in her element among poor
people, or in the hunting-field, and would
be quite miserable in India. She is going
to marry Augustus Moore; they are devotedly
attached to one another, and he
has known her from her childhood.”</p>
</div>

<p>“<i>Mentitor fortiter</i>,” was Mrs. Redmond’s
motto, and to do her justice, she
lived up to it; in a crisis like the present
<i>what</i> was a lie more or less? This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
notable falsehood gave a neat and suitable
finish to the whole scheme. Moreover,
like all lies of the most dangerous class,
it contained a grain of the truth—Augustus
Moore had known Betty from childhood,
and a less keen-sighted woman than
the mistress of Noone, could see that he
was her slave; the match was merely a
question of time.</p>

<p>“In withholding your offer from Betty,”
the letter went on to say, “I am sparing
you the mortification of a refusal. I
have put the round people in the round
holes in spite of you, you see, and by
the time you are reading this, Belle (who
knows nothing, poor darling) will be half
way to India with the Calverts. Betty
has been helping her most zealously in
her preparations, and keeping up all our
spirits with her merry ways, and gay
little jokes and songs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“I do not know what we should have
done without her; she has not the
faintest suspicion that you care for her,
for all her thoughts are fixed in <i>another</i>
direction. Be good to Belle—she is quite
a child, a spoiled child in many ways;
she is not much of a manager or housekeeper,
for I have wished her to make
the most of her youth, and only asked
her to be happy and to look pretty. She
is devoted to you, and has been so from
the very first, though with true maidenly
dignity she has concealed her feelings—even
from <i>me</i>, but I know that the prospect
of being your wife, has filled her
with unspeakable happiness. Perhaps,
after all, you may repudiate her love,
you may refuse to receive her, and leave
her a friendless, nervous, sensitive girl,
unwelcomed in a strange land—only to
return home broken-hearted, dis-illusioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and disgraced; but I scarcely believe you
will be capable of this, knowing that she
loves you, confides in you, and has no
friends in India. Do not answer this
letter. I may as well tell you, candidly,
that if you do I shall not read it, but
will put it into the fire, for in my failing
health, my medical man advises me
strictly against any kind of unnecessary
agitation. Pray, believe me yours most
faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Emma Redmond.</span>”<br>
</p>

<p>By the time George Holroyd had come
to the end of this precious epistle, it
would be impossible to describe his feelings;
they were a mixture of incredulity,
horror, agonising disappointment, and uncontrollable
fury.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Redmond was mad!” this he
swore with a great oath; “or he was
mad, and everyone was mad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>He seized his mother’s letter, much as
a drowning man clutches at a straw;
it proved to be a somewhat querulous
effusion, wondering that he had never
given <i>her</i> a hint of his intentions, amazed
to hear of his engagement to Belle, and
pathetically imploring him to “think it
over,” but wishing him every happiness—whatever
his fate. Delighted at the
news of his uncle’s generosity, and hinting
(nay, more than hinting) that he
might share some of his good fortune
with Denis—openly stating that his poor
dear brother wrote the most pitiful accounts
of his circumstances, and that she
was sure he would be annoyed to hear
that he had actually applied to Mrs.
Maccabe for pecuniary assistance, instead
of to his <i>own</i> flesh and blood, and
that a line to Denis Malone, care of
the barman at the Kangaroo Arms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Albany, South Australia, would always
find him.</p>

<p>George put this epistle aside, and tore
open Belle’s envelope with a shaking
hand.</p>

<p>When his eyes fell on the page beginning
“My own, own darling,” he crumbled
the letter up into a ball, and dashed it from
him with anything but a lover-like gesture.</p>

<p>Then he rose and began to walk about
the room like a man possessed. He might
have guessed how it would be! Betty
was not bound to him in any way, and
whilst he had been toiling for her in
silence, at the other side of the world—Ghosty
Moore was within speech—within
a ride!</p>

<p>Ghosty Moore was rich, young, and
popular. He could give her everything
her heart desired. She would marry him,
and be beloved, admired and happy. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
county lady with half a dozen hunters,
and as many dogs as she pleased. As
for him, his life was wrecked, it did not
matter what became of him; he threw
himself into a chair, leant his arms on
the table, buried his head in them, and
wished himself dead.</p>

<p>That Betty was lost to him was beyond
doubt, and that Belle was on her way out
to marry him, was also beyond doubt;
but no, he said to himself fiercely, he
would never make her his wife, and thus
fulfil the schemes, and be the easy tool,
of her iniquitous old mother; never!</p>

<p>To have the dearest hopes of his life
dispersed by one shattering blow was
surely sufficiently hard for a man to
bear, but to have another fate imperatively
thrust on him within the same
hour—a fate from which his highest and
best feelings instinctively recoiled—a fate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
that his heart most passionately repudiated—this
was to drink the cup of bitterness
to the dregs, twice!</p>

<p>And if he refused to accept Belle as his
bride, what was his alternative? he asked
himself, with fierce perplexity.</p>

<p>He felt dazed and stunned; the more
he endeavoured to muster his thoughts,
to pursue ideas, to reach some definite
plan, the more unmanageable those
thoughts and ideas became.</p>

<p>It was desperately hard to realise that
one short ten minutes had changed the
whole current of his life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Even to one’s old familiar friend, I
doubt if it is wise to give the entrée to
your private room at all hours. He may
chance to find a soul in earthly torment,
a mind <i>en deshabille</i>, with the mask of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
conventionality, and the cloak of reserve,
torn off, and thrown to the winds.</p>

<p>Captain La Touche was whistling
cheerily as he crossed the verandah, and
entered his comrade’s apartment. He
looked cool, handsome, and debonnair in
his creaseless white suit and spotless
linen (he was such a dandy that he
actually sent his shirts twice a month to
England to be washed; and oh! feat
beyond the dhoby!<i>glazed</i>). He had
evidently had a good mail, for his face
was radiant, and he carried a packet of
letters, and a French comic paper in his
hand. All at once his whistling ceased,
as his eyes fell on his comrade’s prone
head—and the torn and discarded letters
scattered broadcast about the floor.</p>

<p>“Hullo, George, my dear old chap!”
he exclaimed, “you have not any bad
news I hope. No one dead, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>George raised a rigid white face to his,
and gazed at him blankly and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Your money gone again, eh?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come then, it can’t be so very
bad, pull yourself together, my son, and
have a whisky and soda; you look as
if you had been knocked into the middle
of next week. What is it all about?”</p>

<p>“I’ve—I’ve a splitting headache.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and is <i>that</i> all?” rather dubiously.</p>

<p>“And some rather worrying letters,”
he continued, making a great effort to
carry out the second part of his visitor’s
prescription. “I shall be all right by
and by, don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>At first a wild idea had flashed
through his brain. He would consult
his friend, and put the whole story before
him, like a hard case in <i>Vanity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Fair</i>, and say, “supposing a man proposes
for one girl, and another comes
out instead, believing that <i>she</i> is the
right one—what would you do? Marry
her?” But as he gazed at Captain La
Touche, that sleek, prosperous, cynical
bachelor, Lord President of the Mess
(sometimes a heritage of woe) and bitter
enemy of matrimony, his heart failed
him. “Joe,” as he was called, would
explode into one of his loud bursts of
laughter, and declare that it was the best
joke he had ever heard in the whole
course of his life! Instead of being
sober-minded and sympathetic, he would
chaffingly examine the capabilities of the
subjects for burlesque treatment; he
would be jocose and unbearable. But in
this belief George did his friend injustice!</p>

<p>In one vivid mental flash, he saw the
ordeal he would now have to face at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
mess, an ordeal he dared not confront.
The good-humoured jokes, congratulations,
and presents of his brother officers, were
acceptable enough yesterday, but <i>to-day</i>
they would be torture, as it were, searing
a gaping wound with red-hot iron. How
was he to assume a part—he being no
actor at the best of times—the part of
the happy and expectant bridegroom!
His thoughts flew to a certain lonely dâk
bungalow, about twenty miles out, rarely
frequented, and sufficiently far from the
haunts of men. He would go in at once
for ten days’ leave for snipe shooting,
put a few things together, and gallop out
there as soon as orderly-room was over.
He must be alone, like some wounded
animal, that plunges into the thicket,
when it has received a mortal hurt—that
it may die apart from its fellows, and
endure its agony unseen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Once there, he would have time to
advise with himself, to review the whole
burning question, and to meditate on
falsified hopes, abandoned aims, and a
lost love.</p>

<p>The maturing of this sudden project
did not occupy sixty seconds, and Captain
La Touche was still standing interrogatively
in the doorway.</p>

<p>“I’m not feeling very fit, Joe, the
cramming <i>is</i> beginning to tell as you
predicted. I think I shall go out for ten
days’ snipe shooting, to blow the cobwebs
out of my brains.”</p>

<p>“It’s too early for snipe,” objected his
visitor, “make it the end of next week,
and <i>I’ll</i> go with you, old man!”</p>

<p>“I saw several wisps coming in last
evening and——”</p>

<p>“And of course I <i>forgot</i>,” interrupted
the other jocosely, “your time is short,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
poor fellow, and who knows if it may
not be your <i>last</i> shoot. Such things have
happened! Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of Sungoo,” he returned
rather nervously.</p>

<p>“Sungoo! A nasty feverish hole! I
would not go there if I were you.”</p>

<p>“There are several first class jheels
about, and I’d like to make a good bag,”
returned the other, now lying as freely
as Mrs. Redmond herself.</p>

<p>“Well, well, have your own way, you
always do,” returned his chum with a
French shrug of his broad shoulders.
“’Pon my word, you gave me a jolly
good fright, just now, I thought there
was bad news, something up at home.
By-bye,” and he opened his big white
umbrella, and strode off to breakfast.</p>

<p>Sungoo dâk bungalow was retired
enough for St. Anthony himself; it stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
aloof from the high road, behind a clump
of bamboos, and a hedge of somewhat
dusty cactus.</p>

<p>George Holroyd’s active bearer made
daily raids on the nearest village for fowl
and eggs and goat’s milk, whilst his
master paced the verandah, or tramped
over the country, and fought with his
thoughts, and endeavoured to shape out
his future life. Willingly would he
change his lot for that of one of the
cheerful brown tillers of the soil, by
whom he was surrounded, and whom
he came across in his long and aimless
wanderings. How absorbed and
interested was that young fellow, as he sat
at the edge of a tank, dividing his time
between his bamboo rod, and bobbing
line, and the inevitable <i>huka</i> that stood
beside him.</p>

<p><i>He</i> did not seem to have a care in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
world!—and it was never likely to be
<i>his</i> fate to marry a woman against his
will! All the same, did his envious
observer but know the truth, it was more
than probable that the same young man
had been married from his cradle.</p>

<p>Sungoo dâk bungalow was not only
famed for seclusion and sport—it was notoriously
unhealthy; the rank vegetation
and the vapours from the neighbouring
reedy snipe jheels made it an undesirable
residence. Hideous spiders with wormy
legs, and semi-tame toads abounded in
the three small rooms. Mushrooms grew
out of the walls, a family of noisy civet
cats lodged in the roof, hundreds of frogs
held oratorios in a neighbouring pond,
rendering sleep impossible—and altogether
it was as damp and dreary a dwelling as
anyone could wish to see; and a man
who had taken a dislike to existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
could not have chosen a more congenial
abode.</p>

<p>One day George’s bearer went considerably
further than the nearest mud-walled
village; he galloped post haste into
Mangobad, and informed Captain La
Touche and his brother officers that his
master was very ill, in a raging fever,
and “talking very strangely.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” vociferated his chum, “I
was afraid there was something up. You
notice he never sent in a <i>single</i> brace of
snipe, and he knows what a boon they
are.”</p>

<p>He and the station doctor set off at
once, and brought the patient in the next
morning in a dhooly. He was still in a
high fever, but perfectly conscious and alive
to his surroundings.</p>

<p>For days he had been racked with an
uncontrollable longing to see Betty only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
once, and to speak to her face to face—as
vain a longing as that of the wretched
captive in a deep, dark dungeon, who languishes
to see the sun!</p>

<p>As Captain La Touche sat by him, and
gazed at him anxiously, he opened his
eyes, and said in a low voice: “Joe, I
would give half my life to see her but for
five minutes—and to speak to her face to
face.”</p>

<p>Captain La Touche was exceedingly
concerned, and subsequently told his
brother officers that it looked like a bad
business, for Holroyd was still delirious
and wandering in his mind.</p>

<p>Ten days’ excellent nursing brought him
round, and the doctor was most assiduous
in what he called “patching him up” in
order that he might be in time to meet
the steamer. Nevertheless all George’s
friends were shocked at the change that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
such a short illness had made in his
appearance. He looked as if he had aged
ten years in ten days; his eyes were
sunken, his cheeks hollow, and he was so
weak and emaciated that, according to
one of his comrades, “he appeared to
be walking about, to save the expenses of
his funeral,” and in this cheerful condition
he went down to Bombay, to accept
the inevitable, and to receive his bride.</p>

<p>“On the 5th instant, at the Cathedral,
Bombay, by the Rev. Erasmus Jones,
George Holroyd, Lieutenant, Her Majesty’s
Royal Musketeers, only son of the late
George Holroyd, and grandson of Sir
Mowbray Holroyd, of Rivals Place, county
Durham, to Isabelle Felicité, daughter of
the late Fergus Redmond, grand-niece of
Lord Bogberry, and great-grand-niece of
the Marquis of Round Tower. By Telegram.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Redmond herself had composed
this high-sounding announcement, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
handed it to Colonel Calvert, with instructions
to insert the date, and not to
trust it to Holroyd, but to see to it himself—perhaps
in her secret heart she feared
that George might modify her magnificent
composition.</p>

<p>The wedding was strictly private, and
if the bridegroom looked haggard and
pre-occupied, the bride was both blooming
and beaming. The Calverts and Miss
Gay were the only guests, and after the
ceremony, the happy pair went direct to
the railway station, and departed on a
tour up country. They visited Jeypore,
Ajmir, Delhi, Agra, and Lucknow. Belle
liked the bustle, the constant change,
the novelty of her surroundings, the
admiring eyes of other passengers, and
the luxury of having every wish most
carefully studied. But she did not much
appreciate Indian sights and Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
scenery. She gave them but a very cursory
notice, her attention being chiefly centred
on her fellow travellers. It was the flood-tide
of the globe-trotting season—English,
Americans, French, and Australians, were
scattered over the land in hundreds,
“doing India,” from a certain point of
view, and believing that when they had
seen the Taj at Agra, the burning ghaut
at Benares, the snows at Darjeeling, a
snake charmer, and a fakeer, they were
henceforth qualified authorities on the
Eastern question! The hotels were
crammed, the proprietors reaping a golden
harvest, and often at their wits’ end
to find quarters for their guests. Belle
enjoyed the numerous and varied society
she met at the table d’hôte, her roving,
challenging dark eyes daily wandered
among what were, to her, entirely new
types. There was the purse-proud, tubby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
little man, who scorned the letter H and
expected to be served as promptly and
as obsequiously as if he were in his own
house; who roared and stormed in English
at amazed Mahomedan khitmatgars, who
did not understand either him or his
wants. There were the people who entered
into conversation right and left, and cheerfully
discussed plans and places, the people
who never opened their mouths but to receive
their forks—or knives; the people who
ate everything, the people who barely tasted
a morsel—and the delicate couple from Calcutta
who had brought their own cook!
The American party, mostly wearing
pince-nez, bright, brisk, agreeable, seeing
the world at rail-road speed and pleased
with all they saw, sleeping in trains,
eating in “ticca” gharries, <i>en route</i> to
some sight, and writing up their diaries
at every spare moment. The English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
family—comprised of a father collecting
facts, a mother collecting pottery, two
pretty daughters, a valet and a maid—to
whom time and money were no object,
and who were a perfect fortune to the
hawkers who haunted the hotel verandahs.
There was the gentleman from New Zealand,
who was surprised at nothing but
the gigantic size of the cockroaches, and
the ruddy-cheeked youth from Belfast,
who was surprised at everything, and who
half expected to see tigers sporting on
the Apollo Bunder or chasing the Bombay
trams; also the two cautious ladies,
who brought their hand-bags to the table,
and read guide books between the courses.
Moreover, there was the handsome rich
young man who had come out to shoot
big game, and discoursed eloquently of
the delights of the Terai, and the merits
of explosive bullets, and shikar elephants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and was not unlikely to be “brought
down” himself by the bright eyes of an
Australian girl, who played off Japan
against the jungles. Last, but not least,
the seasoned Anglo-Indian, passing through
to his district or his regiment up country,
who spoke the language glibly, helped
his fellow creatures to make their wants
understood, and seemed absolutely at home
with his trusty bearer, his bedding, and
his tiffin basket—and being well known
to the hotel baboo, and so to speak on
his adopted heath, secured, without a
second’s demur, the best room, and the
best attention. Many of these travellers
were encountered by the Holroyds over
and over again, and Belle, in her lively
way, had devised nicknames for most of
them; nor did they themselves pass unnoticed.
No one suspected them of being
newly married, for Belle, though smartly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
dressed and remarkably handsome, was no
young girl; nor were she and her husband
selfishly absorbed in one another, to the
exclusion of ordinary mortals. They were
known among their companies as “the
lady with the poodle,” and “the man
with the headache,” for George looked as
if he were a continual martyr to that
distressing affliction. He was unmistakably
an officer—the lively girl who had
been in Japan declared she guessed it
by his boots—and the couple were supposed
to be residents taking a little
cold weather tour, <i>à la</i> Darby and Joan.
This mistake was intolerable to Belle,
and she pursued one harmless lady
with undying animosity, because as they
were shuffling out to Amba, on the
same elephant, she had innocently remarked:</p>

<p>“I suppose this sort of a ride is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
novelty to you—you are quite accustomed
to India.”</p>

<p>Belle, whose temper was precarious, and
who was now in a deadly fright, and
consequently inclined to be cross, said
snappishly:</p>

<p>“Pray <i>how</i> long do you suppose I have
been married?”</p>

<p>“Well, say ten years——”</p>

<p>“Say ten days,” rejoined the bride,
with laconic severity.</p>

<p>“Oh my! I <i>am</i> vexed. Well, I hope
you’ll excuse me;” but Belle did not do
anything so generous, and cut her dead
when they subsequently met at Laurie’s
Hotel, Agra. The moon was full and, as
a natural consequence, so was the hotel;
for what sight so renowned as the Taj by
moonlight? Belle went over the fort,
grumbling and reluctant, in the wake
of a conscientious guide; the day was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
warm and there was far too much to see!
The Motee Musjid, the Jasmin Tower,
the dining halls, durbar halls, tilting yards,
court yards, and baths—the combined
works of Akbar and Shahjehan. Her
taste was more for the horrible than the
beautiful, and when she was taken from
marble halls above, to dark dungeons and
underground passages below, and when
she had crawled, torch in hand, through
a hole in the wall, and seen with her
own eyes the secret chamber where women
of the palace were strangled and thrown
into the Jumna, she expressed herself as
deeply interested and gratified. The tomb
across the river was duly visited, and
then the Taj. Yes. She admired it!
but it aroused her enthusiasm in a much
fainter degree than the contents of a shop
of gold and silver embroidery, although
the sight that bursts on the traveller as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
enters the great gateway, and catches the
first glimpse of the approach, surmounted
by the famous dome and minarets, is
surely unsurpassed. The Taj, to translate
its name, is “the crown” of every building
in the world, and it is to be regretted
that Shahjehan did not live to carry out
his intention of building a similar tomb
for himself in black marble at the other
side of the river, connecting the two by
a marble bridge.</p>

<p>Belle agreed to a second visit by moonlight,
because, as she assured herself,
“it was a thing to say she had seen,”
but the admiration the Tomb evoked, the
intent look on men’s faces, the tears in the
women’s eyes, merely filled her with amazement
and derision. She praised the delicate
Italian inlaid work, and the lace-like
marble screens, and tried her not particularly
sweet voice, under the echoing dome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
with a shrill roulade that considerably
startled her unprepared audience. At
eleven o’clock at night she again found
herself in the Taj gardens; “much too
early,” she grumbled, as she seated herself
on a bench half-way between the
Taj and the entrance. “The other
people won’t be here for an hour.” It
was evidently “other people” she had
come to see. George made no remark;
he stood behind her with his arms folded.
He had always secretly worshipped the
beautiful in nature and art—an Indian
sunset in the rains, a chain of lofty snow-clad
peaks at sunrise, a fair landscape
bathed in moonlight, appealed at once to
his taste, and the building before him, with
its pearl-white dome rising into the dark
blue starry sky, the stately grace of this
crown of love, the beauty of this perfect
monument to a woman’s memory, crept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
into his senses and sank into his soul.
The moon was so bright, the air so clear,
that he could distinguish the fretwork,
and the heavy-headed lilies around the
basement of the tomb, and this garden, in
which “the light of the Harem” had lain
for eighteen years—whilst thousands of
workmen laboured, aye, and died for her
fame—was truly a fitting setting for so
pure a gem of art, with its tall trees and
paved walks, its fountains and fish ponds,
its masses of yellow roses and groves of
fragrant orange blossoms, now filling the
air with their perfume. What a paradise
for lovers, thought George, an ideal spot
for whispered vows this exquisite Eastern
night! But what had <i>he</i> to do with love?
He was a married man, and in his heart,
there was not one spark of love for the
smart little lady, with the dog on her knee,
who was his own, his wife, his other self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
for evermore, who had a right to be
beside him, and to share his lot, as long
as they both should live. Esteem he
might give her, respect and a certain
kind of admiration, and possibly affection;
but love—Never! Meanwhile it was his
most urgent duty to disguise the truth,
and sharp as Belle was, she never once
guessed it. Who could be more attentive
than George? Her merest hint was
caught at, the best carriages and best
rooms were secured for her everywhere
in advance by telegram; he protected
her from rain or heat, from draught or
dust, as if she were made of wax. And
he had given her most lovely presents.
Such a diamond ring and such a pair
of earrings! If poor Maria Finny could
only see them she would die—die of
envy, hatred and malice. His affection
was not demonstrative but practical—and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
as such, was appreciated and preferred.</p>

<p>As George’s sombre eyes fell upon his
companion, he noticed that she was now
gazing at the Taj in an entirely different
attitude, with an air of rapt, absorbed
meditation. Ah, it had grown on her at
last, as it did on every one; she had
even dislodged “Mossoo,” who was hunting
frogs, with all the zeal of his nation.</p>

<p>“Well, Belle, a penny for your
thoughts?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh,” rousing herself to look at him.
“Well, I was wondering, if I could get
any curling pins here? and do you know,
that I have been thinking seriously about
that blue and silver dress front; perhaps
I ought to take the pink one after all—you
remember the one at the corner shop;
there was more stuff for the body. What
do you say, dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Here was a companion with whom to
gaze on earth’s loveliness! No, no, Belle
had, as she boasted, no sentiment about
her; she did not care for past greatness,—the
marble glories of Shahjehan, nor
the red granite courts of Akbar. She
much preferred the present age, a brisk
drive back to the hotel, and a nice little
hot supper; yes, she would rather have
mulled claret and cutlets, than moonlight
and marble!</p>

<p>“Have <i>both</i> if you like,” returned
George after a momentary silence, “and
had we not better be making a start?”</p>

<p>“Both!” rising to her feet. “Oh,
you dear, good, generous George,” taking
his arm as she spoke. “If you are
quite sure that I am not too extravagant,
for there is something else I want.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“A present for Betty; you know how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
good she has been to me; she really
worked like a slave to get me ready,
and I would like to send her something
pretty; it need not cost much, but she
has no nice things, no generous George
to give her presents,” glancing up
coquettishly into his face. How white he
looked—or was it the moon? “You
know what a dull life she leads—any
little pleasure, any little surprise——”</p>

<p>“She won’t be dull when she is Mrs.
Moore,” he interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>“I shall tell you a great secret, that no
one knows but me; she will never marry
Ghosty, never. She was quite angry with
me, when I teased her. She declares
she will never marry any one, and if she
keeps her word, as I hope she will—for
who is there to marry at Ballingoole?—it
will make my mind <i>so</i> easy about poor
mamma!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>As Belle made this sweet, unselfish
remark, they had reached the entrance,
and whilst she was coaxing “Mossoo”
into the carriage, George turned away,
ostensibly to take one last look at the
Taj as it appeared framed by the great
gateway, but it was not of the Taj that
he was thinking. Although his eyes were
resting on a vision of a dazzling white
dome and minarets, he was a prey to tormenting
speculation; he was asking himself
a startling question. Could Mrs. Redmond
have lied to him? Or was Betty’s speech
merely a girl’s hypocritical repudiation of
a lover. Who was the most likely to
speak the truth, Mrs. Redmond or Betty?</p>

<p>As Belle and her husband drove
rapidly back towards the cantonments,
with “Mossoo” extended on the front
seat of the landau, they were unusually
silent; not one word was spoken about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
their recent expedition—they seemed
buried in their own thoughts.</p>

<p><i>She</i> was busily engaged in mentally
making up the pink and silver satin, and
<i>he</i> was thinking, that if what Belle had
just told him was true—as true as she
appeared to believe—he never would have
married her!</p>

<p>Two days later, Mrs. Holroyd was
sitting in the hotel verandah, surrounded
by jewellers, their wares displayed temptingly
in the invariable manner on Turkey
red.</p>

<p>“Well! what about that present?”
enquired her husband, as he discovered
her. “Get something good. Will two
hundred rupees do?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred! I was thinking of
fifty. What a lavish, extravagant fellow
you are; you will ruin yourself if I
don’t look after you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>But she accepted the sum, in spite of
her pretty protestations.—George was
beginning to know what these protestations
were worth!—Belle carefully selected
a delicate gold bangle, and exhibited it
on her own wrist, with much complacency.</p>

<p>“You are not going to give her <i>that</i>,
are you?” he enquired with secret dismay.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought of it at first; it
would almost match one you sent her,
but really it is too much to give her, and
on second thoughts,” with a playful air,
“don’t you think it looks very well on
<i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course it does; leave it
where it is,” he said with eager acquiescence,
“you must keep it yourself.”</p>

<p>Anything was better than sending
Betty a second bangle, and Belle, the
munificent, the grateful, the honourable,
chose for her cousin—when her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
was not present—a simple brooch, value
thirty rupees, though she told him it
cost eighty—and pocketed the balance.</p>

<p>From Agra, the Holroyds went to
Cawnpore—melancholy Cawnpore!—with
its dusty, glaring roads, grim barracks
and tragic history. The garrulous guide
who drove them round, lolled at his
ease half into the carriage, preferring
the <i>rôle</i> of <i>raconteur</i> to coachman, leaving
the horses chiefly to themselves; but
no doubt, they knew the too familiar
weary rounds, from Nana Sahib’s ruinous
house, to the entrenchments—the Memorial
Church—the massacre ghaut—and
the well. The full details of the tragedy
had a horrible fascination for Belle, and
despite her husband’s continual interruptions
and denials, she would hear all;
and the guide, for once, had a listener
entirely after his own heart; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Indian mid-day sun, and Indian atrocities
were too much for this excitable traveller
with a lurid imagination. A climax
arrived, when she stood gazing at the
angel over the well, that exquisite
embodiment of sorrow and peace—which
the guide glibly assured her was “the
work of ‘Mackitty,’ the same man who
had built the Taj, at Agra.” As she
gazed with twitching lips, and working
eyebrows, she said, “You call it a lovely
face, George! Not at all. To me, it is
not a face of sorrow, but a face of cold,
undying vengeance. Yes, vengeance,” she
added, raising her voice to a scream and
glaring at the guide with a wild flicker
in her eyes, “why don’t you keep a
supply of natives here for us who come
on pilgrimage? I know what <i>I</i> would
do to them, with my own hands.”</p>

<p>She looked so odd and excited, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the old soldier was completely cowed, and
ceased to relate how “he and Havelock”
had marched to the relief of Cawnpore.
This handsome lady had a strange face,
she was muttering to herself, and gnawing
her handkerchief, as she lay back on the
carriage cushions, and she had passionately
tossed his humble offering—a bit
of yew from the site of the house of
massacre—far away into the powdery
white road. He had not even the presence
of mind to ask for a whiskey peg, when
George paid him off at the station, but
he whispered confidentially as he pocketed
his rupees:</p>

<p>“I’ve seen ’em in hysterics, and I’ve
seen ’em crying, but I never saw one
take on like <i>her</i> before,” indicating Belle
with his horny thumb. “She <i>would</i> draw
me on, you see—and all them times is
real to me—I was in ’em, and my words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
has worked on her feelings, them and
the sun has done it; keep her cool and
quiet, and she may come all right in time
for the mail train.”</p>

<p>But was it the sun? A terrible
thought, a sickening dread, occurred to
George; was there not a gleam of
insanity in those fiery red eyes that encountered
his, in the dim light of the
waiting-room? He and her ayah applied
ice and eau-de-cologne to her head, and
kept her in a still, dark room in complete
quiet, and this regimen wrought a
speedy cure. By the following morning
Belle declared herself ready to go on at
once, to go anywhere, and they proceeded
to Lucknow. The grey shell-shattered
walls of the Residency, the scene of her
countrymen and women’s heroic resistance,
had no more interest for Mrs. Holroyd
than the Taj. The Silver Bazaar and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
cavalry band at the “Chutter Munzil,”
were far more to her taste, not to speak
of a screaming farce at the Mahomed
Bagh Theatre. At length they turned
their faces towards Mangobad, and as
the train steamed out of Lucknow Station,
George, as he carefully arranged Belle’s
pillows and rugs, and books and fans,
breathed a deep sigh of thankfulness and
relief—<i>At any rate the honeymoon was
over.</i></p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br><span class="small">A NEW LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Holroyds arrived at Mangobad, with
unexpected punctuality, and Belle was in
raptures with her new home—her <i>own</i>
house—a spacious, well-situated bungalow,
replete with every comfort. There
was a German piano, a pony and cart, a
cheval glass, a sewing machine, new jail
carpets and matting, pretty curtains and
furniture, and ornaments, a verandah filled
with plants, and birds; and a tribe of
respectable black-whiskered servants, with
unimpeachable “chits” awaiting her good
pleasure.</p>

<p>Truly nothing had been forgotten;
this bungalow had undoubtedly been
fitted up by a lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Belle danced about, and clapped her
hands, gesticulated, and ran from room
to room like a child of six. Little did
she guess that all these delightful,
thoughtful preparations—had been made
for another person.</p>

<p>For several days after her arrival, she
was excessively busy, unpacking and
shaking out her dresses and beautifying
the drawing-room, with rapid and tasteful
fingers. A palm in this corner, a screen
in that, a graceful drapery here, a bow
of ribbon there, photographs, fans and
cushions abounded—in a short time the
room was transformed as if by magic,
but its mistress’s zeal was evanescent.
Once a thing was done there was an end
of it; the palms might wither, the
draperies gather dust, for all she noted.
She detested sustained effort. However,
everything was in its pristine freshness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
when her visitors began to make their
appearance.</p>

<p>Captain La Touche was naturally the
first to call upon his friend’s bride. He
drove up in his dog-cart, dressed in his
most recent Europe suit, and brimming
over with curiosity and <i>bonhomie</i>.</p>

<p>Mem Sahib gave “salaam” and he
was shown into the drawing-room, and
there waited for a considerable time,
whilst he heard sounds of someone skirmishing
with drawers and wardrobe doors,
in the next apartment.</p>

<p>He was full of pleasant anticipations of
a girl of nineteen, tall and slim, with
beautiful, Irish grey eyes, even in her
cheap, blurred photograph she had a
sweet face!</p>

<p>But who was <i>this</i>? that pulled back
the purdah and came tripping into the
room. A pretty little brunette, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Frenchified dress and an artificial smile.
He rose and bowed, waiting expectantly
for another figure—that was surely yet
to come.</p>

<p>“I know you so very well by name,”
said Belle, offering a pair of tiny (somewhat
bony) hands. “My husband is
always talking of Captain La Touche.”</p>

<p>Then this was the bride; he was in
the presence of Mrs. Holroyd! At first
he was so utterly confounded, that he
could only sit down and stare into the
crown of his hat. Belle attributed his
evident embarrassment to the dazzling
effect of her own charms, and immediately
set to work to converse in her
gayest strain, in order to put him at his
ease. She was the first person who had
ever thought it necessary to attempt this
feat with Captain La Touche! As she
chatted with her usual fluency, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
listened and looked. Truly, this is no
shy girl of nineteen, but a woman ten
years older, with a knowledge of the
world, and a pleasant confidence in her
own powers. He noted the elaborate
elegance of her dress, the vivid beauty of
her dark, animated face; but, despite
their long lashes, her eyes had a hard
expression, and her thin red lips spoke of
cruelty, and temper.</p>

<p>However, he dissembled his feelings
(like the immortal stage ruffian), and
talked and flattered and laughed, in his
most irresistible company manner.</p>

<p>Belle, on her side, was agreeably impressed
by her suave and good-looking
visitor. She remembered that he had
given them a handsome wedding present,
and was inclined to be more cordial than
brides usually are, towards their husband’s
bachelor friends. He discoursed of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
station, she of her passage out. He asked
how she liked her house, and she enquired
if there were any balls coming
off, and if the ladies of Mangobad were
young and pretty!</p>

<p>“You must judge for yourself,” he returned
diplomatically, “you have brought
us out one young lady, Miss Gay—Miss
Rose Gay.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she ought to be called Miss
Nosegay,” returned Belle smartly. “You
never saw such a feature out of <i>Punch</i>.”</p>

<p>“Is she, then, not pretty?” he enquired
with arched brows.</p>

<p>“Pretty, poor girl!” throwing up her
hands, “her face is so hideous that I am
sure it must hurt her!” and she
laughed, and evidently expected her
visitor to do the same, but he merely
smiled and said, “At any rate she is
very clever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Of course she is, like all ugly people;
she is <i>said</i> to be very clever and good-natured;
for my part, I loathe good-natured
girls.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Holroyd was outspoken, and not
very amiable; this sharp tongue might
prove a dangerous element in a small
station. Presently he rose and took his
leave. As he was quitting the room, his
eye fell on a large photograph of Betty.
Belle noticed his glance, and hastening to
take it up, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, you are looking at my cousin—my
dearest friend; she is a darling, not
a beauty, as you may observe, but quite
charming. I wish you could see her. I
wish she was here.” Captain La Touche
sincerely echoed the wish, as he bowed
himself out, and walked down the hall.
He had never been so completely mystified
in all his life. His friend had distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
told him, that he was going
to marry Betty—and who was Betty’s
substitute?</p>

<p>On the steps of the porch he met
George, who had just ridden home from
the ranges.</p>

<p>“I see you have been making your
salaams,” said he with well-affected nonchalance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” acquiesced his comrade. But
for the life of him he could not utter
another word. He looked hard at his
friend, his friend looked hard at him,
and, from what he read in Holroyd’s
eyes, he dared not ask the question that
was burning on his tongue, so he got
into his dog-cart in silence, and drove
himself away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holroyd’s next visitor was the
Collector, her namesake, Mr. Redmond.
She knew that he was a rich, eccentric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
widower, just the sort of person that
would repay a little cultivation, just the
sort of person to invite her out to camp,
and to give her diamonds and ponies, for
was he not Betty’s uncle? She intended
to make great capital out of her cousin,
stand in her place and stroke his grey
hair, and smooth his withered cheek, and
call him “Uncle Bernard,” but all these
pretty little schemes were projected
before she had <i>seen</i> Mr. Redmond. He
was one of the relatives with whom old
Brian had quarrelled most rancorously,
and his offer to provide for his brother’s
orphan had been rudely scorned. In
those days Mrs. Redmond was alive,
and as she was not very enthusiastic
about her husband’s niece, the matter had
dropped. But now Mr. Redmond paid
an early visit to the bride, not so much
to do her honour, as to enquire about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Betty. Bernard Redmond, Esq., C.S.,
was a tall, square-shouldered man, with
grizzled, sandy hair, a somewhat saturnine
expression, and a masterful individuality.
He was intellectual and deeply read,
open-handed, hospitable and eccentric, was
well aware that he was considered
“peculiar,” and took an unaffected delight
in acting up to his reputation. In spite
of his so-called odd opinions, he was
extremely popular, for he gave a good
dinner, and unimpeachable wine, played
quite a first-class rubber, and was a
sound authority on horseflesh. Mr. Redmond
brooked no contradiction, was autocratic,
and extraordinarily outspoken—traits
that grew upon him year by year,
and were fostered and nourished at
Mangobad, where he ruled not only the
district, but the station, and was to all
intents and purposes its “uncrowned king.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Belle’s pretty smiles and speeches, her
graceful attitudes, and waving hands,
were absolutely wasted on this cynical
person with the cold grey eyes. He
listened patiently to her chatter, and her
views of life, mentally exclaiming “Good
Lord! What a fool this woman is!”
for the tone of her conversation jarred on
him considerably; there was a great deal
too much about Mrs. George Holroyd.
Nevertheless he received a glowing description
of his niece, in which description
Belle painted herself as Betty’s adviser,
sister, and benefactress, and then he put
one or two somewhat sharp questions—questions
are a natural weapon in malignant
hands.</p>

<p>“I remember your father,” he said:
“he died when I was a youngster, about
eight and twenty years ago. I suppose
you were quite an infant at that time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Quite,” she returned somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>“Betty is nineteen,” he continued;
“she has two hundred a year; pray,
what becomes of her income?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell,” faltered Belle. “My
mother knows” (she truly did).</p>

<p>“And I gather that she is at Noone
acting as your mother’s sick nurse?”</p>

<p>“She <i>lives</i> with mamma,” replied Belle,
reddening.</p>

<p>“Ha—Hum!” rubbing his chin reflectively.
Then putting on his glasses,
and staring round, “I should not have
known this house.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not,” complacently.
“Pray, what do you think of my
room?”</p>

<p>“Shall I really tell you what I think.
Eh, honestly and without humbug?”</p>

<p>“Please do,” prepared for some charming
compliment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“I think it just like a bazaar, with
all these pictures, and ribbons, and cushions,
and fans. I cannot help looking
for the tickets, and expecting to hear you
ask me to put into a raffle.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Redmond,” exclaimed Belle, intensely
affronted. “It is very evident that
you have not been in England for some
years, and possibly then you may not
have been in a <i>drawing-room</i>, or else I believe
you are as great a bear as old Brian.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I am,” he returned with
a delighted laugh. “I have often regretted
the loss I have been to the
diplomatic service! Don’t you know
that manners run in our family?”</p>

<p>“The want of them you mean,” indignantly.
“This room is got up in the
very latest fashion.”</p>

<p>“Like its mistress?” with a cool, deliberate
stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. <i>I</i> attempt to be civilised!”</p>

<p>“And of course I know that I am
miserably behindhand. A poor old mofussilite!
Pray what’s that thing?”
pointing to “Mossoo,” who was coiled
up in a chair. “Animal, vegetable or
mineral?”</p>

<p>“It’s my dog—a thoroughbred French
poodle. I brought him with me.”</p>

<p>“The latest fashion in poodles—I suppose.
Eh?” focussing “Mossoo” with
his glass. “I wonder what the dogs out
here will take him for! How do you
like India?”</p>

<p>“Extremely—I don’t wish ever to go
home; I hope I shall live and die out here!
I love it better and better every day.”</p>

<p>“You have only been out five weeks;
wait till you have been out for five years,
and you have heard the brain fever bird,
and felt the hot winds, and seen a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
snakes and scorpions! India is not a
country; it is a climate.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! I am not afraid of
your horrors; I shall go to the hills, and
I intend to enjoy myself in hills and
plains, and to like India immensely. I
suppose <i>you</i> were out here long before
the Mutiny?”</p>

<p>“The Mutiny! Good gracious, my
dear madam,” exclaimed her visitor
(whose one vulnerable point happened to
be his age, and flattered himself that he
did not look a day older than forty).
“For what do you take me? Long before
the Mutiny! Why I have only
twenty-seven years’ service.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon. I did not
know; but I daresay climate tells on
people—you <i>look</i> old.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he responded quickly.
“I see that you understand the art of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
delicate flattery. Ah!” as a note was
handed to her. “You have already
begun to experience the real curse of
India—chits, yes, ma’am—chits are the
curse of India, and I will leave you to
enjoy your epistle alone; it is sure to be
asking for something; your company at
a dull dinner; the loan of a pattern, or
of a saddle; or a bottle of wine; or a
dose of medicine!”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” rejoined Belle, casting
her eyes over it. “It is from Mr. Lovelace,
sending snipe, and asking me to
play tennis. I am afraid you take a
gloomy view of life, and people in
general.”</p>

<p>“I take a gloomy view of <i>some</i> people,
I must confess,” and then he got up
rather abruptly and made his adieux,
and Belle had a disagreeable consciousness,
that she had failed to make a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
impression. Visions of diamonds, and
ponies, faded back into cloudland, and she
laughed aloud, as she pictured herself
daring to pat this gruff outspoken connection
on the head, much less to stroke
his severe, sarcastic-looking face! As he
whirled away, he remarked to his hot-tempered
pony: “She is like you, Judy,
a Tartar, if ever there was one! She
will want a tight curb and a strong hand
over her. Poor Holroyd. Unfortunate
devil!”</p>

<p>Belle’s other visitors were more appreciative,
and they came, all the ladies
in the Station, in their latest Europe
bonnets, and all the inquisitive young
men, in their neatest ties and boots, and
they were charmed with the bride—the
latter especially. She had such splendid
eyes, and so much to say for herself, and
was so unaffected and agreeable. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Mrs. Calvert and Miss Gay had not been
<i>half</i> loud enough in her praises! They
had not prepared them for such an acquisition
to Mangobad. True, when one
or two enthusiastic subalterns at the
Club had been eloquent on the subject
of the lady’s charms of person and manner,
in the hearing of the Collector, he
had merely grunted, and shrugged his
shoulders, and called for a glass of
“Kummel,” but he was a regular old
Diogenes, and no one minded his opinion,
excepting on such matters as horses,
whist, and wine.</p>

<p>Belle’s letters home were full of her
delightful new life, and her supreme
happiness, and Mrs. Redmond read them
to her friends, in a voice that shook with
emotion. Her plans had succeeded far
beyond her most sanguine hopes. In
spite of what the Bible said, the wicked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
did prosper! After all, she had only
done evil that good might come, and good
<i>had</i> come. She did not fail to impart
Belle’s effusions to Betty—who listened
with a white but smiling face—to Maria,
and to Miss Dopping; accounts of tiffin
parties, dinners, and dances, given for her
as a bride, and what she had worn, and
how her dress had fitted, and who had
taken her in, and what people had said;
also minute descriptions of her legion of
servants, her house, her piano, her ponies,
and her plate (a splendid and enlarged
edition of the above was soon in circulation
in the village), but there was scarcely an
allusion to her lord and master. He was
constantly on duty; he seemed to have an
immensity to do; he looked ill, and had
quite lost his spirits; he took no care of
himself, and she intended to carry him off to
some gay hill station for a complete change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“It was not Belle’s custom to talk of
anything that was near her heart,” explained
her mother. “She is extremely
anxious about him, I can see, but her
feelings are not on the surface.”</p>

<p>“Nor anywhere else,” muttered Miss
Dopping; then aloud: “It strikes me that
she seems a good deal <i>more</i> anxious about
getting the creases out of her velvet dress!
However, I am glad you are pleased. If
she was my daughter, I’d rather hear less
about her clothes and more about her
husband.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Belle’s triumphs had not been much
over-rated. She was quite the latest
novelty, and the acknowledged beauty of
the station. Young men were proud to
be her partners in ball-room or tennis
court. She was vivacious, amusing and
accomplished; and her pretty dresses and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
her pretty speeches disarmed her would-be
rivals. She took the place by storm as
on board the <i>Nankin</i>, and no entertainment
was complete without Mrs. Holroyd!
She acted, she sang at penny readings,
she composed people’s fancy dresses, she
played the harmonium in church, and was
secretary to the tennis club. In fact, as
old Sally Dopping would have said, “She
had a finger in every pie.” Her restless
spirit, and excitable temperament, supplied
her with sufficient energy to revolve in
one untiring whirl from morn till midnight.
She was always <i>en course</i>. She
drove to the club before breakfast to read
the papers and gossip; early in the afternoon,
she went forth again, regardless of
the sun, a syce holding an umbrella over
her head, and “Mossoo” sitting sedately
in the cart beside her, to tiffin parties,
teas, or tennis; then there were rehearsals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
for concerts, theatricals, choir practice,
moonlight picnics and balls. For these
latter Belle filled in her programme (in
ink) days previously.</p>

<p>Home was the place where she slept,
and breakfasted, and sometimes dined, but
home was not where she “lived” in the
true sense of the word. In it she expected
no happiness for herself, and made
none for others. Pleasure was her god,
and to this she carried the sacrifice of her
life. With constant gaiety came an incessant
hunger, a craving for more. Not
content with Mangobad she sighed for
other fields to conquer; she went to this
station, and to that, for the annual
“Week,” to Lucknow for the cup-races,
to Allahabad for balls, bearing her husband
in her train. Gay, vivacious, pretty, a
born actress, a matchless dancer, Belle, as
she playfully expressed it, “took” extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
well. George gratified all her
whims, patiently hung about ball-room
doors till the early hours of the morning,
carried her wraps, cashed her cheques, went
her messages, and gave her freely and
liberally of everything—except his company.
For the first time in her existence,
Belle was absolutely contented. This really
<i>was</i> life—a life well worth living, a
glorious realisation of all her hopes. But
would it last?</p>

<p>Alas! This gay butterfly life was not permanent!
Before six months had passed,
Mrs. Holroyd had ceased to be the joy
and delight of the station. Before a year
had elapsed, she had figuratively thrust
a torch into her own roof tree, and set
Mangobad in a blaze.</p>

<p>The honeymoon had barely waned, before
George Holroyd discovered that he was
married to an insanely jealous woman,
with an ungovernable temper, and an
untrammelled tongue. He had seen her
tear an ill-fitting dress to shreds with
the gestures of a maniac, he had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
her strike her ayah, and stamp at himself.
True, she had subsequently offered
a rupee to the ayah, and sobs and
apologies to him, and that these outbreaks
were always followed by scenes
almost equally trying—fits of hysterical
remorse, but the future looked gloomy,
very gloomy. Belle was not in love with
her husband, brave, handsome, and honest
as he was. She would have (privately)
jeered at the idea. She had a vague
notion that she had been in love once—years
ago—that she was constant to “a
memory”—a gross mental deception; her
first love was with her still, and confronted
her daily in the glass. Were
the choice given her to be torn from
her husband or “Mossoo,” it would not
have been “Mossoo.” But he was a good-looking,
presentable appendage, whose
polo playing and hurdle racing reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
credit on herself. Since his marriage he
had given up tennis and dancing, and
to this she made no objection, for it
kept him somewhat aloof from ladies’
society. She could not endure to see
him speaking to another young woman.
She, herself, was to be admired by all;
he was to admire no one.</p>

<p>As for George, he was woefully
changed; he had become silent, solitary,
and perhaps a little cynical. He had
done his utmost to be a good husband to
Belle, believing, in his folly, that she
had been desperately in love with him,
but he was soon disabused of <i>this</i> error.
When at home, Belle was generally recruiting
her exhausted powers; she read, and
yawned, but rarely talked; and, when
abroad, she never noticed her husband save
to make jokes at his expense, and to send
him on her errands. Many a day when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
returned from barracks, fagged and weary,
he found the bird flown, the nest empty,
and the bird’s absence a relief. “Mem
Sahib bahar gaya.” The Mem Sahib was
much too nervous to ride; she did not care
for driving along monotonous roads, that led
nowhere in particular. The splendid sunsets,
the waving fields of yellow rice and
millet, the majestic clumps of forest trees
and picturesque rivers, with the cattle
swimming homewards at sunset, had no
charms for her, nor the dazzling flight of
green parrots, nor the teak trees’ feathery
flowers—nor the <i>tête-à-tête</i> with George!
No, no, she much preferred to bowl down
to the club to hear the latest “gup,”
display her dresses, and play tennis. And
her husband spent his time among the
racket, and whist and billiard players, as
if he were a mere bachelor (Oh that he
were!) At public and private entertainments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
his wife constantly made him
the hero of her little stories, and the butt of
her malicious jokes. This he bore without
wincing, but when she levelled her shafts
at others, he protested most emphatically.</p>

<p>One night they returned late from a
large dinner party, where Belle had made
herself surprisingly disagreeable, and had
shown more than a glimpse of the cloven
foot. Possibly something had irritated
her—a supposed slight, a tight shoe, or
it might be, what Miss Dopping would
have called “just pure divilment.” George
followed her into the drawing-room, resolved
to speak sternly, and to scotch
the fire at once.</p>

<p>“Belle, what possessed you to-night?”
he asked in sharp incisive tones, unlike
his usual manner.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she snapped,
turning on him quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“You told Mrs. Craddock, who has
fiery hair, that you never trusted a red-headed
woman; they were invariably deceitful
and ill-tempered.”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite true, so they are.”</p>

<p>“You told Colonel Scott that you despised
all black regiments.”</p>

<p>“So I do.”</p>

<p>“You gave Mrs. Lundy, in polite words,
the lie.”</p>

<p>“I did far worse than that!” exclaimed
Belle triumphantly. “When we were all
in the drawing-rooms afterwards, and talking
of the fancy-ball, they appealed to
me about Mrs. Mountain’s costume. I
said she was so large, and her face was
so red, she might wear her usual dress,
with a paper frill round her neck, and go
as a round of beef! And only fancy!
She turns out to be Mrs. Lundy’s <i>mother</i>!
Laugh, George, <i>do</i> laugh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“No, certainly I shall not laugh. I
am like Mr. Redmond. I never see a
joke after ten o’clock at night, even where
there is one to see. I was amazed at you
this evening; you abused people’s friends,
you abused my regiment. If you cannot
restrain your tongue, we won’t dine in
public again.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?” she demanded scornfully.</p>

<p>“I do,” he rejoined with resolute determination.</p>

<p>“Pooh! you can stay by yourself then
and I shall go alone, and all the better!”
and she tossed her head with a gesture of
defiance.</p>

<p>“If you do, it will be only once.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I shall send you home,” he
answered with prompt sternness.</p>

<p>“Send me home. Ha! ha! ha! What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
a joke. To whom—to your mother?”
and she burst into a scream of laughter.</p>

<p>“No, to yours.”</p>

<p>“I would not go—I will never go.”</p>

<p>“We would soon see about that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we would. I would shriek, and
scream, and have to be carried to the
railway by force. I would make a scene
at every station between this and Bombay;
and if you <i>did</i> get me on board, I’d return
in the pilot boat. No, no. Husband and
wife should never be separated. Nothing
but death should part them—nothing—but—death—shall—part—you
and me,”
she concluded with laboured distinctness.</p>

<p>“Belle, you are talking nonsense; talking
like a fool.”</p>

<p>“Am I? but I am not such a fool as
to go to the hills, or to hateful Ballingoole,
and leave you here to flirt with
Janie Wray.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Wray!” he echoed; “I have
scarcely spoken ten words to her in my
life.”</p>

<p>“You see her out with the hounds
when I cannot look after you; you gave
her the brush—and I am told that she
says you are the handsomest man in the
station. She had better not let me see
her flirting with you, that’s all,” she concluded
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Miss Wray—it’s too bad to talk of
her in this way! on my honour she is
no more to me than that picture on the
wall.”</p>

<p>“Nor am I!” cried Belle fiercely.
“Nor any woman! I don’t believe you
care a straw about me. I don’t believe, in
spite of the letter you wrote, that you
ever loved me. Come——” suddenly
walking up to him, “be honest, answer
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“I married you—that is my answer,”
he replied after a pause.</p>

<p>“True, and I had no money—my face
was my fortune,” exclaimed Belle, gazing
at him thoughtfully. “And yet I sometimes
think that you are capable of <i>une
grande passion</i>, of being desperately in
love. Were you ever in love before you
met me? Was there ever any other girl,
George?” she exclaimed in a much
sharper key. “George, speak! Why
do you look so white? There <i>was</i> some
one——”</p>

<p>“Do I ever ask to look into your past?”
he interrupted impatiently.</p>

<p>“Then it’s <i>true</i>—you have admitted
as much. Who is she? Where is she?
Have I seen her? Is she alive?”</p>

<p>Belle’s eyes flamed like two lamps as
she seized his arm and shook it violently.</p>

<p>“Ah—you won’t tell me! George, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
I dreamt that you cared for her still—I
could kill her, do you hear? you had
better keep us apart, you know I have
a high spirit,” and the lines of her face
twitched convulsively.</p>

<p>“I know you have a high temper,”
calmly removing her hand. “And it is
rather late hours for heroics. If you will
take <i>my</i> advice, you will leave my past
alone—you will be more amiable at future
entertainments, and you will now go to
bed.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Belle was not very robust; according
to her mother she had a great spirit in
a frail body, and according to Captain
La Touche “her engines were much too
powerful for her frame.” Her folly in
braving the sun, and her life of ceaseless
activity, began to tell; long before the
hot weather was heralded in by that most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
obnoxious of the feathered tribe, “the
brain fever bird.” She suffered from fever
and ague—her face became sallow, her
eyes sunken, and her figure lost its
roundness and her thin red lips their
smile.</p>

<p>The climate of India is said to be trying
to the temper, but Belle’s temper
was trying to the whole station. Once
the novelty of her new house had worn
off, she began to harry her domestics,
with merciless energy; she was unreasonable,
unmethodical, and capricious; and
deplorably mean about small things. She
foamed at the mouth over a lost <i>jharun</i>
(duster), fined transgressors relentlessly,
and in one great gust of fury, dismissed
the whole respectable black-bearded retinue,
without wages or character, but they gave
her a fine character in the bazaars, and
she subsequently discovered that no good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
self-respecting servant would engage with
her, even for double wages. By the time
she had been six months in Mangobad
her household troubles were the joke of
the place, but they were no joke to her
husband; to him they were a most tragic
reality. Belle began her day at six o’clock
by bursting out of the house with a shriek
at the milkman; then she had a painful
scene with the cook and his accounts,
and the daily giving out of the stores was
looked upon as a sort of “forlorn hope.”
Belle had always been what Sally Dopping
termed, very “near” in her ideas—save
with respect to outlay on her own
little luxuries and personal adornment;
and this trait in her character had
developed enormously of late, and pressed
sorely on her unlucky retainers; she
weighed out each chittack of butter, and
each ounce of sugar, with her own fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
hands; there was no latitude allowed in
the matter of “ghee,” and she made
searching enquiries after empty bottles,
and bare bones.</p>

<p>Only the bravest dared to face the
Mem Sahib! Every egg, every bottle
of lamp oil, every seer of gram, was
figuratively fought over, and only wrested
from her and carried off after a severe
action. Naturally, it was but the very
worst class of servants who would engage
in her service—the incapable, drunken,
dishonest, or miserably poor. She soon
picked up sufficient of the vernacular to
call them “idiots, pigs, and devils,” and
had a dreadful way of creeping unexpectedly
about their godowns, and
pouncing on them when they were enjoying
the soothing “huka” at unlawful
hours. Not a week passed without an
explosion, and dismissal; in six months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
she had thirty cooks; George’s life was
wretched, especially since Belle had been
compelled to relinquish some of her amusements,
and had taken so fiercely to
housekeeping; squalid meals (an hour
late), dusty rooms, insolent attendants,
and the shrill voice of the wife of his
bosom, storming incessantly. Their little
dinner parties covered him with shame
and confusion, and although Belle, gaily
dressed, talked and laughed vivaciously,
and subsequently sang, what talking and
singing can appease a hungry man?
Mysterious soups, poisonous entrées—half
full of cinders, a universal flavouring of
mellow ghee, and, on one immortal occasion,
cod liver oil handed about as a
liqueur. Belle always declared that this
particular “faux pas” was the act of a
diabolical “khitmatgar,” who did it for
spite. Be that as it may, it was but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
cold comfort to those unhappy guests
who had swallowed a glass of noxious
medicine, as a kind of “chasse” to a
gruesome dinner! Mrs. Holroyd’s temper
developed month by month. Hasty
speeches, furious retorts, combustible notes,
dislocated various friendships. She quarrelled
with the chaplain about a hymn—with
Captain La Touche about a waltz—disputes
over newspapers, tennis, flowers,
precedence, embroiled her with half the
station, and here she could not shift her
sky, as in the good old days, when she
roamed about with her mother, and their
lives were a series of hegiras. No, it was
now George’s unhappy lot to be apologist
and peacemaker, to interview angry and
insulted ladies, and to draft copies of
humble letters—occasionally the effect of
these epistles was minimised, by Belle’s
surreptitious postscript, “I don’t mean this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
letter in the <i>least</i>, but George made me
write it.”</p>

<p>Poor George! once (<i>only</i> once) he got
out his revolver, and handled it meditatively;
but no, what about his mother,
and the regiment, and Betty? No, to take
his own life would be the act of a coward.
A climax came at last when the tennis
tournament was in full swing. Belle
played with her usual skill and vigour,
but at lawn tennis it is a fatal mistake
to become feverishly excited, and to lose
your temper. Belle lost hers, and also
the ladies’ doubles. She fought desperately
hard for the singles, the general and
friendly interest in her adversary goading
her to frenzy; after a most exciting match,
she was beaten by one point, and in a
transport of disappointment and rage,
launched an anathema, and her racquet,
at her opponent’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>The Mangobad community was kind.
They talked of “a touch of the sun,”
and Belle was really laid up with intermittent
fever. The doctor conferred with
George, and recommended Mrs. Holroyd a
<i>complete</i> change of scene and a sea voyage!
In short there was a universal feeling
that either she, or the rest of the population,
would have to leave the station—and
she went.</p>

<p>Belle had a cousin in Melbourne, who
(having never seen her) had sent her
more than one pressing invitation. This
invitation was now graciously accepted,
and George escorted his wife and “Mossoo”
down to Calcutta, put them on board a
P. and O. in charge of the captain, and
returned to Mangobad, a free man. Yes—for
six months he was a free man; and
he hoped that his joy was not indecently
manifest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>He shut up his house, and departed on
a two months’ shooting trip with Captain
La Touche. It was quite like old times,
and, by mutual consent, they scrupulously
avoided the remotest allusion to a certain
absent lady. They became two collarless
vagabonds. They went into Thibet, and
had capital sport, and returned to the
station at the very last hour of their leave,
sunburnt and satisfied, thirsting for regimental
soda-water, and the latest regimental
news.</p>

<p>The travellers had scarcely entered the
mess, and hardly exchanged greetings with
their friends, when an officious comrade
rushed at George open-mouthed, saying:
“<i>Your wife is back</i>, arrived three days
ago; she only stayed a week in Australia.”</p>

<p>“What?” stammered George, turning
pale beneath his tan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—I saw her yesterday. She returned
in the same steamer, and is very
fit. She loathed Melbourne, and said she
knew you could not get on without her.”</p>

<p>Alas! This was no hoax—it was painfully,
pitifully true (and there was a
unanimous impression that Garwood might
have kept his news till George had had
his breakfast). Belle spent exactly ten
days with her cousin—a strong-minded
forcible woman, who told her some very
wholesome facts, and made no objection
to her premature departure. Belle detested
Melbourne, and her relative—was afraid
that George might be flirting (Poor
George! he had had a lesson for life)—gave
out that her health was completely
restored, and that her husband was miserable
in her absence, and so took ship.</p>

<p>But her Australian trip was of benefit
to Mrs. Holroyd in more ways than one!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
She was more reasonable, more manageable,
and more mild.</p>

<p>Long-suffering Mangobad noted the
change with the deepest gratitude to Belle’s
unknown kinswoman, received the prodigal
politely, and signed a treaty of peace.</p>

<p>The flame of Mrs. Redmond’s life flickered
along unsteadily from day to day, and
month to month. She was now entirely
bed-ridden, and the strain of constant
nursing wore Betty down a good deal.
Occasionally Maria Finny came and spent
an hour or two in the sick room—and
subsequently spread alarming reports in
the village, where deaths and births were
the only exciting events; a marriage was
rare indeed. Once she even went so far
as to assure Mrs. Maccabe, that the dying
woman “could not possibly put over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
night,” and to request that a very superior
sirloin (then hanging in the shop) should
be immediately set aside for the funeral
breakfast! but when Maria hurried to
Noone the next morning she found the
invalid not merely alive, but better—better
and fretful.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she said in answer to Maria’s
query, “I was bad enough yesterday—yes,
you thought I was going—I could
have died if I <i>liked</i>, long ago, but I am
holding on—holding on—at least till the
next mail comes in.”</p>

<p>All she seemed to care for now was
the Indian mail, but how many mails
come in and brought her no letters!
Belle was enjoying herself without a
thought of her. It was Betty who was
her real daughter, the girl whom she had
wronged. Every one else was going from
her, and she was going from every one!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
The old lady was not in a happy frame
of mind, she was filled with remorse
now.</p>

<p>Betty’s determined refusal of Ghosty
Moore had opened her eyes, but had
occasioned no surprise to Miss Dopping.
That excellent lady had her own private
views, and was truly concerned to see
her young friend so hollow-eyed and pale,
so different from what she used to be!
But Betty never uttered a word of complaint,
and she struggled along bravely
under the heavy tasks imposed on her;
she was a-foot all day—the first to rise, the
last to go to rest, therefore Miss Dopping
drove over one afternoon to have a serious
talk with Mrs. Redmond, about getting a
professional nurse to take some of the load
off Betty’s shoulders, but the miserly
patient turned a deaf ear to her suggestion.
A trained nurse would require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
wages, she would certainly eat—possibly
she would drink porter!</p>

<p>“Betty,” she declared, “did very well.
Betty liked nursing. Betty could manage
alone.”</p>

<p>And as the wish was father to the
thought, Mrs. Redmond believed it, and
relapsed into her normal condition of
torpid selfishness.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I should do without
her, or what she will do without me,”
she groaned. “It’s a great trial that she
won’t look at Ghosty Moore. She has
refused him twice. I can’t understand
her, and the Moores so fond of her, and
such a splendid connection, and for Belle
too. It’s too bad of Betty. Have you
any idea of her real reason?”</p>

<p>“I believe I have,” replied Miss
Dopping with unexpected promptness.
“I always thought that George Holroyd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
was in love with Betty, and that she had
a fancy for him.” As she spoke she
looked sharply at her questioner, and
Mrs. Redmond’s face betrayed her; she
was weak, and had lost the command of
her countenance.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell, her lips twitched nervously,
a faint guilty colour stole into
her pallid face.</p>

<p>In a second, the astute old maid had
guessed all, and felt disposed to deal with
her companion as Queen Elizabeth did
with the Countess of Nottingham, and
shake the dying woman in her bed, and
declare that “God might forgive her, but
she never would!”</p>

<p>“Then it <i>was</i> Betty?” leaning forward
and speaking in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“It was,” returned the other in a still
fainter key. “Now you know my secret—keep
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“No—not from Betty—in all justice
to George Holroyd, she shall know that
he is a man of honour and did not break
his pledge. Woman! what possessed you
to ruin two lives, and peril your own
immortal soul?”</p>

<p>“Belle is happy—I did it for her,”
protested the culprit.</p>

<p>“And is every one to be sacrificed to
Belle! And <i>is</i> Belle happy? I know
Holroyd is not; other people can write
besides his wife. The Moores’ niece says
she would never have known him—he has
grown so silent and careworn, and as to
Belle, I need not tell you what her temper
is! Nor that she cannot keep a servant,
or a female friend. She is the scourge
and heartscald of the station.”</p>

<p>“He paid her great attention,” faltered
Mrs. Redmond. “She fully expected his
offer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” returned Miss Dopping
scornfully. “She paid <i>him</i> great attention.
I only hope she is half as attentive to
him still! Does she know?”</p>

<p>“No one knows but Holroyd and myself.”</p>

<p>“It was a bold game for an ailing old
woman! I have no doubt the devil helped
you. How did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I gave Betty’s letter to Belle—I had
only to change one word.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must tell Betty at once.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think she is happier not to
know?” faltered the invalid.</p>

<p>“Don’t I think that you are a wicked,
treacherous old creature! She has blamed
the wrong person for more than a year.
Take your sin on your own head. If I
were the girl, I would never forgive you.
You have ruined her life and his. It
would never surprise <i>me</i> if he took to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
drink, or if he were to shoot Belle. I
believe <i>I’d</i> shoot her, if I was married
to her.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense you talk, old Sally
Dopping!” exclaimed the invalid angrily.
“George is a sane, respectable man; he
has got a very pretty, accomplished wife,
and as to Betty—she is young——”</p>

<p>“She is, and before she is a week
older she shall know that George Holroyd
kept faith with her.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell her—I won’t tell her,”
protested the culprit irritably.</p>

<p>“Very well! it would come better
from you than me; you may sweeten
your story—I shall not. I give you
three days’ law, three days to make up
your mind—not an hour longer.”</p>

<p>And then Miss Dopping arose, holding
herself unusually erect, seized her umbrella,
and marched straight out of the room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
without another word—without even the
formality of “Good afternoon.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Redmond endured Miss Dopping’s
daily “Have you told her?” for a
whole week, before she mustered up her
courage and spoke. It was at night
time, when the house was closed and
silent. Betty had been reading the Bible,
seated at a small table, with the lamp-light
falling on her face—a face that
could not be implacable.</p>

<p>“Betty,” began the invalid suddenly,
“I have something important to say to
you. Open my dressing-case—the key is
in it, and take a letter out of the flap.”</p>

<p>Betty rose and did as desired. Mrs.
Redmond received the letter with a shaking
hand, saying, as she did so:</p>

<p>“Sit down and tell me something,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Betty. Did it ever occur to you, that
George Holroyd liked you?”</p>

<p>Betty, who had been standing hitherto,
sat down, and faced her questioner with
silent lips and piteous eyes.</p>

<p>“How could he?” she said at last in
a very low voice. “He married Belle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Betty, he did, and I must ease
my mind and confess a great wrong to you
before I die. He married Belle because I
made him marry her.”</p>

<p>“You!—I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You know that Belle was my idol
ever since she was born. I would have
died for her. I was prepared to make any
sacrifice for her. I—I sacrificed <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>Betty leant her arms on the table, and
gazed at her aunt with a colourless face.</p>

<p>“The letter I gave to Belle was yours,
addressed under cover to me, to Miss
Elizabeth Redmond; he only mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
your name once. I was sorely tempted;
the letter would apply equally well to
Belle. I blotted out that word. I gave
it to her, and now she is away at the
other end of the world, dancing and singing
and amusing herself, whilst you are the
only comfort of the wicked woman who
spoiled your life. But Belle fretted so
dreadfully, her heart was set on change.
She never dreamt that he cared for <i>you</i>.
His proposal to you would have been an
awful blow. I dared not tell her; you
remember her attacks—her violent nervous
attacks? A doctor once told me that
her frenzies bordered on insanity, and
that any sudden nervous shock might—might—Betty
dear,” lowering her voice,
“you and I alone know—though we have
never, never spoken of it—that sometimes
she was a little strange—not quite herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Betty recalled, with a shiver, one dark
winter’s night, when, after a day of
terrible depression, Belle had appeared
suddenly in the study, her hair wet, a
table knife gleaming in her hand, and
an odd wild look in her eyes. “Do you
know what I have been doing?” she
asked triumphantly.</p>

<p>“I felt that I must do something or
go mad. I saw Maggie going out to the
poultry yard with a knife and a candle.
I went with her. I killed a fowl. I cut
its throat. I <i>liked</i> doing it! Yes, I
did.”</p>

<p>“Betty—Betty do not cover your
face,” pleaded Mrs. Redmond. “Are you
very, very angry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what is the good of being
angry?” moaned the girl, with a long
shuddering sigh, and the old lady noticed
that tears were trickling through her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
fingers. Tears not wholly of grief. It
was balm to her wounded heart to know
that, though lost to her for ever, George
had not been false, nor she willingly forsaken.
He had been faithful. Poor
George!</p>

<p>“Of course I know you will never
forgive me,” whimpered Mrs. Redmond.
“You will go away, and leave me, and
I shall die with no one near me but a
strange hospital nurse, who will rob me
out of the face. Oh! I am sorry I ever
told you. It was all old Sally’s doing.
She <i>made</i> me.”</p>

<p>“No—no—aunt, do not be afraid that
I shall desert you; but oh! what must
he think of me?”</p>

<p>“He knows all. I wrote very plainly,
and here is his letter to me—keep it. It
was a bold venture sending out Belle. I
wonder I had the strength and nerve to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
go through that awful time. Supposing
he had refused to marry her, and she
had been cast adrift helpless and penniless!
I declare I never had a real night’s
rest until I got the telegram to say that
the wedding was over.”</p>

<p>“You might have trusted him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, especially when I told him that
you were soon to be married to Ghosty
Moore, and had never given him a
thought.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Emma!”</p>

<p>The girl’s voice was sharp with pain,
and she trembled from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I stuck at nothing; but
then I must say, that I had no suspicion
that you liked George Holroyd, and I
was confident that you would accept
Augustus Moore. I wrote everything
quite frankly to Holroyd—and he married
Belle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“Does she know?” enquired Betty
faintly.</p>

<p>“Know? Oh, no! and never will;
but after all I am afraid they are not
very happy. He is sure not to understand
her temper—it’s all over so soon
too, and, poor girl, she is always sorry.
Betty, you must promise me solemnly
that he shall never know that <i>you</i> know.”</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” she returned.
“We shall never meet again, but whether
or no, I can make no promise.”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose you would not go out
to Belle?”</p>

<p>“<i>Aunt Emma!</i>”</p>

<p>“You know she is always wishing for
you; she is a jealous girl, and of course
if she knew, she would as soon have the
plague in the house! Well, I must say,
Betty, you have taken it beautifully;
you are a dear good child; come and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
kiss me. I shall sleep all the better for
having a load off my mind, and when
you have settled the fire, and fixed the
night-light, and given me my draught,
you can go.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Redmond slept peacefully that
night, with heavy long-drawn snores, but
Betty sat hour after hour in her window,
with dry, tearless eyes, looking out upon
the stars that seemed to return her gaze
with sympathy, and shone with a frosty
brightness. She was still sitting there
when they began to pale. The next
time Miss Dopping came to Noone she
found Maria closeted with Betty, whilst
the invalid was asleep.</p>

<p>“No letter from Belle this morning, I
suppose?” enquired the old lady.</p>

<p>“No, but I heard of her,” returned
Maria with eager volubility. “I was at
the Moores’ yesterday and met their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
niece, who is just home from India. She
saw Belle lately; she has lost every
scrap of her looks, and is as yellow as a
kite’s claw; her temper has worn her
to fiddle-strings, and they are as much
afraid of her out there as if she were a
mad dog! As to Holroyd, you would
never know him; he is as grave and as
silent as if he were at a priest’s funeral.
I always knew it would be a miserable
match.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>you</i> say that of every match,
Maria,” rejoined Miss Dopping. “I don’t
believe half I hear. What about this new
tea of Casey’s? Have you tried it?”</p>

<p>“No,” snapped Maria, who saw that
the topic was disagreeable, and naturally
pursued it. “I can’t tell you anything
about the tea, but I would be thankful
if you would tell me, <i>what</i> possessed
young Holroyd to marry Isabella?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>Miss Sally’s glance met Betty’s.</p>

<p>Betty blushed, and she read in the
girl’s eyes that the tale had been told.</p>

<p>“He was no more in love with her
than he was with <i>me</i>,” continued Miss
Finny emphatically. “Do you think she
had any hold over him, or knew some
secret in his past about money, or——?”</p>

<p>“Murder! say it out boldly. Secret
in his past indeed,” repeated Miss Dopping.
“Tut, tut, Maria! I could not
have believed that a woman of your age
could be such a fool, but of course there’s
no fool like an old one.” Nevertheless
Miss Dopping glanced somewhat nervously
out of the corner of her eye at Betty.
But Betty was staring into the fire.</p>

<p>A few days later Mrs. Redmond had
passed away tranquilly in her sleep, with
all Belle’s letters—no great quantity—under
her pillow, and Belle’s most flattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
photograph grasped in her rigid
hand.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Holroyd received the news of her
mother’s death in her usual extravagant
fashion. She wept, and raved, and
screamed, and roamed about the house
in her dressing-gown, with her hair loose,
subsisted on sal-volatile and champagne,
and angrily refused all comfort. She
ordered the deepest mourning, and tied
a wide black ribbon round “Mossoo’s”
neck.</p>

<p>At the end of three days, she went
out driving for the sake of her health,
and despatched a very business-like letter
to Betty, respecting her darling mother’s
rings, and plate, and household effects.
At the end of the week, she was playing
tennis with her usual vigour and agility,
and at the end of a month, even to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
husband’s surprise, she was talking of
leaving off her crape, and regretting that
she could not take part in some theatricals,
and society (not easily scandalised) was
shocked to see Belle subsequently give
way to precisely the same violent outbreak
of grief over a dead monkey as she
had recently displayed at the death of
her mother! And in future, society
tapped its forehead and looked significant
when it spoke of Mrs. Holroyd.</p>

<p>One afternoon, not long after her
double bereavement, Belle was amazed
and flattered to hear that the Collector
Sahib was at the door, and to receive
Mr. Redmond’s card. He had come solely
to talk to her about his niece Betty, he
informed her with his usual bluntness.
“Where is she now?” he enquired, as
he carefully selected a seat. “Tell me
all you know about her.” Now that Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Redmond was dead, he was resolved to
assert his claim as her nearest of kin,
and to import her to India as his companion,
housekeeper, and adopted daughter—for,
in spite of the tempting snares
that were spread for him, he had no
inclination to marry again.</p>

<p>“She is at Ballingoole with Miss
Dopping. I wanted to have had her out,
but George is so queer, he says married
people are best alone.”</p>

<p>“Some are,” assented Mr. Redmond,
stroking his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And although she is not very pretty,
not the least like <i>me</i>, she would be quite
a beauty among the hideous girls that
are here. I’d have seen that she made a
good match, and not married a wretched
subaltern like George, but a Bengal Civilian
like yourself. Don’t say that <i>I</i> never
pay you a compliment!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” he replied, in his driest
manner. “Tell me one thing, Mrs. Holroyd,
does she resemble you in any way?”</p>

<p>“No,” rejoined Belle with a triumphant
laugh, “you would never dream that we
were related. We are as opposite as the
poles, and the same people never like us!
I mean people that like Betty, hate me,
and <i>vice versâ</i>. She is tall, and has grey
eyes and rides splendidly, and is quite a
cook. <i>You</i> would appreciate that! She
has wonderful spirits, and the nerves of
a man, but she is not really pretty, or
taking; she is not sympathetic with men;
in fact, poor mother—she was so partial—always
said she was a capital foil for
<i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“I can easily believe it,” he rejoined
with an irony that was completely lost
on his fair listener. “And what about
her temper?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“No one has ever seen her angry in
her life—really angry, you know—of course
she is cross now and then; she has that
serene disposition that, mother said, always
went with an insipid character.”</p>

<p>“Your description enchants me! I
delight in insipid people,” exclaimed Mr.
Redmond, rubbing his chin quite fiercely.
“Ha, hum! a good cook, a good rider,
plain, insipid, and serene. I shall write
by the mail to-morrow—I am her nearest
of kin—and ask her to come out and live
with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear, darling, delightful old
man!” cried Belle, springing from her
seat. “Oh, you angel, I declare I should
like to kiss you, I really should.”</p>

<p>“I beg, madam, that you will do
nothing of the sort,” backing away as
he spoke. “And let me ask one thing.
For goodness’ sake don’t go gabbling my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
plans all over the station. I hate to have
my private affairs discussed by a pack of
women, and besides, she may not come.
She may prefer Ballingoole and Miss
Dopping.”</p>

<p>“Miss Dopping will <i>send</i> her out—she
thinks Betty is lost in Ballingoole. She
often said so. She is sure to come! And
to what a delightful home. Carriages,
horses, and everything. I suppose you
will give her the blue room? Can I
help you to get it ready? Do tell me,
can I do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, keep my news to yourself, that
is all you can do. You may tell your
husband, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall not mention it to a soul,
you may rely on that; it shall be a dead
secret between you and me. It will be
capital fun. I shall keep it as a grand
surprise for George.”</p>

<p>A few people in the station knew that
the Collector was expecting a niece, but
the news never reached George’s ears.
He did not frequent the ladies’ room
at the Club, nor other likely sources of
general or particular information. Belle
hugged her secret in silence, as far as he
was concerned, and implored Captain La
Touche (who had his suspicions about this
other Miss Redmond, and was prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to stand by for some frightful domestic
explosion) not to breathe a word on the
subject. It was to be a grand surprise
for George.</p>

<p>Mr. Redmond himself escorted Betty
from Bombay, and the morning after their
arrival Belle hurried over at an early
hour, to greet her cousin, whom she
nearly smothered with her caresses. She
looked critically at Betty, as they sat
over “chota hazree” in the pretty fern-lined
verandah, and she told herself that
her cousin was much changed. She was
more composed, more self-reliant, and—was
it possible?—dignified. She carried
herself with quite an air of distinction, and
was remarkably well dressed. Belle would
certainly think twice before patronising,
bullying, or storming at <i>this</i> Betty. And
how Belle’s tongue ran on. She scarcely
gave her companion time to answer a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
question; volubly setting forth her delight
at her arrival, the condition of her own
health, the state of her wardrobe, asking in
one breath what sort of a passage she had
had, inquiring for the Finnys and Moores,
and how hats were worn; giving hasty and
not always pleasing sketches of the other
ladies in the station, and winding up
with an imperious command to come over
and see her bungalow, “only next door,
only in the next compound.”</p>

<p>Betty assented, saying with a laugh, as
Belle took her arm, “I don’t even know
what a compound is; it might be a lake
or a parish.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Holroyd had done up her house
in honour of her cousin’s arrival; re-arranged
the draperies, replaced the palms
and re-adjusted the furniture, and proudly
convoyed her from room to room.</p>

<p>“You will find George a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
changed, very gloomy and silent,” she
remarked, as she displayed his dressing-room,
with its rows of boots and
saddlery. “My dear, you never know a
man’s <i>real</i> character till you marry him.
In old days he used to be rather jolly,
now——” and she turned up her eyes,
and threw up her hands dramatically,
“he is like the chief mourner at a
funeral. By the way, Betty, why did
you not marry Ghosty Moore? You
were mad to refuse him! I warn you
that you won’t do <i>half</i> as well out
here.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to do half as
well,” returned Betty gaily.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say, that you
are going to be an old maid?”</p>

<p>“Why not? I am convinced that I
should be a delightful one.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish! I know the style. Godmother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
to every one’s horrid baby; sick
nurse to all the wheezy old women; <i>confidante</i>
in love affairs; peace-maker, and
general consoler in times of domestic
affliction. Ugh! sooner than play such
a rôle I’d die.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Belle, you have a kind heart,
you would play your part more creditably
than you pretend.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Betty,” she exclaimed,
inconsequently, “has he said a word
about the diamonds? I suppose not yet—unless
he mentioned them in the train.
I mean your uncle, of course, and of
course they will be yours. What a dry
old creature he is. Quite gritty. Has
he taken to you, dear?”</p>

<p>Betty blushed, and before she had time
to answer, Belle added:</p>

<p>“He told me not to chatter about
you; and only fancy, George does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
know that you are expected, much less
that you have <i>arrived</i>.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Betty, her blush
deepening to scarlet. “Oh, Belle, you
are not in earnest!”</p>

<p>“To be sure I am in earnest. I kept
it as a surprise for him,” and as the
sound of clattering hoofs was heard
rapidly approaching—“Here he is.”</p>

<p>She and her visitor were already in
the hall, as George cantered under the
porch, and she ran to the door, screaming
out, “George, guess who is here.
Guess, guess!”</p>

<p>He, supposing it to be Captain La
Touche, or some other brother officer,
stood for a moment giving orders to his
syce, and then turned to ascend the steps.</p>

<p>But who was this to whom Belle was
clinging? His heart seemed to contract;
his head felt dizzy—as he recognised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
<i>Betty</i>. Betty, grown to womanhood, and
prettier than ever. In one lightning
flash he contrasted the pair before him.
The little dark, sallow woman, with
the shining teeth and tropical eyes, who
was the wife whom fate had sent him,
and the pale, slight, graceful girl, who
was his first love, his heart’s desire, the
wife that he had lost!</p>

<p>George, as he gazed, became as white
as death; he slowly raised his chin-strap,
and removed his helmet, and ascended
the steps with much clattering of sword
and spurs. He could not speak, were it
to save his life. The situation was too
strong for him. He ventured to look at
this rather stately maiden, expecting to
see certain disdain, and possibly hatred
in her eyes, but no, she met his gaze
with a glance of unaffected friendship,
and actually offered him her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“George,” cried Belle excitedly. “How
funny you are! <i>Don’t</i> you remember
Betty? This has been my secret, and
you don’t know what it has cost me to
keep it, but I thought that it would burst
on you as such a delightful surprise.”</p>

<p>George found his tongue at last, as he
said in a level, expressionless voice:
“This is indeed a most unexpected
pleasure! When did you arrive?”</p>

<p>“Last evening by the mail,” rejoined
Betty with desperate cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“I little guessed when I heard yesterday
that Mr. Redmond had gone to Bombay
to meet a lady who that lady was.
Belle,” turning to his garrulous wife, “I
see that you <i>can</i> keep your own counsel.”</p>

<p>“Can I not? Betty, you may trust
me with all your love affairs. I am sure
you have had at least <i>one</i>, and you will
find me a most discreet <i>confidante</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“How did you leave them all at
Ballingoole?” enquired her husband
precipitately.</p>

<p>“Very well, just as usual.”</p>

<p>“And did you see my mother lately?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just before I started. I have
brought you a small parcel from her and
Cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Cuckoo is growing up.”</p>

<p>“She <i>is</i> grown up, in her own estimation;
she wears long dresses and has
abolished her pigtail, and is really quite a
nice-looking girl.”</p>

<p>At this statement, Belle broke into a
peal of derisive laughter, and said, “And
pray what has become of Brown, Jones
and Robinson?”</p>

<p>“Poor Brown is dead; he died of
apoplexy, just like any rich old gentleman.
Mrs. Finny has taken Robinson,
and Miss Dopping, Jones. I was thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
of bringing him out, but I did not
know whether Uncle Bernard liked dogs.”</p>

<p>“And now you know that he is a dog-ridden
man—dogs clamouring at his table,
dogs at his heels, dogs everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and all fox terriers, but none to
compare with Jones. Uncle Bernard has
told me to write for him, and as he is a
dog of independent means he can pay his
own passage. By the way, as I don’t see
him, I suppose ‘Mossoo’ is dead.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dead</i>,” echoed Belle in her shrillest
key. “How dreadfully unfeeling you are,
Betty! Do you suppose for one moment
that you would see me laughing and
talking if I had lost him? No, thank
goodness! ‘Mossoo’ is in splendid health;
this is his morning for the barber. If
anything were to happen to ‘Mossoo’ it
would break my heart. I always hope that
I may die before him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Belle!” exclaimed her kinswoman
in a shocked voice. “I see you are just
as bad as ever, and now,” opening her
white umbrella, “I really must be going.
Uncle Bernard will think that I am lost.
Good-bye, Belle. Good-bye, Mr. Holroyd,”
and she went down the steps and walked
quickly away, with Belle’s last sentence
ringing in her ears:</p>

<p>“Not Mr. Holroyd, Betty; you must
call him <i>George</i>.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>George had stood listening to his wife
and her cousin like a man in a dream.
Was it real—was this girl Betty?</p>

<p>How bright and merry she was, how
her eyes sparkled and smiled—was she a
marvellous actress, a woman with matchless
self-control; or else had she never
cared? Most likely she had never cared.</p>

<p>She was young, and happy, and free,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
whilst he was bound, and fettered, and
wretched.</p>

<p>“Well, George,” said Belle angrily, “I
really think you might have offered to
walk back with her, I do indeed. It’s
rather hard on me that my husband can’t
be civil to the only friend I have in the
world. Do you dislike her?”</p>

<p>“No, why should you suppose so?”</p>

<p>“Then why did you not <i>talk</i>? Why
were you so stiff and ceremonious—so
different from what you used to be at
Noone? You hardly spoke to her, and
she is like my own sister; you might have
kissed her. I am sure she expected it.”</p>

<p>“And I am sure she did nothing of the
kind,” he returned sharply, and then he
went into his writing room, closed the
door and took off his mask.</p>

<p>This was the refinement of torture, the
devil himself had arranged this meeting!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>Surely his lot was bad enough as it
was—a squalid home, a scolding wife, a
broken career. For staff appointments
were inaccessible, he would not dream of
applying for one. People would as soon
have the cholera in the station, as the
notorious Mrs. Holroyd—and now, as the
crown and flower of all his sorrows, here
was Betty, come to witness the misery,
the horror, the daily heart-sickening humiliation
of his married life, and would
naturally say to herself:</p>

<p>“It was for <i>this</i> he forsook and forgot me.”</p>

<p>And she would never know. He must
be for ever silent. In his mind’s eye he
saw Belle, with her irrepressible tongue,
throwing a lurid light on their domestic
life, on their quarrels, on their social
misfortunes, and on all his shortcomings.
At the very thought he clenched his
hands fiercely and great beads of perspiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
stood out on his forehead. He
saw his future, the future he had chosen,
stretching out before him—an awful, barren
waste. He saw that he had made a
hideous mistake, and the iron of a great
despair entered into his soul.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“So you have been over the way
<i>already</i>?” exclaimed Mr. Redmond as his
niece joined him. “Why, you look quite
pale, the journey has knocked you up,
what possessed you to go out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not the least tired; it is no
distance; and you know we are very old
friends. Belle came to fetch me.”</p>

<p>“As long as she does not come and
fetch <i>me</i>, I don’t care. Yes, my dear, I
don’t like your cousin; thank goodness,
your very distant cousin. She is the only
drawback to Mangobad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Bernard, I am so sorry to
hear you say so.”</p>

<p>“Do you like her?” he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do,” returned Betty,
and she believed that she was speaking
the truth.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, you are the mistress
of this house, and I wish to see you
make yourself at home and happy. Have
her here as much as ever you like when
I am away, but I entreat and implore of
you to keep us apart, I am afraid of my
life of her. I am not joking—I am
paralysed by the mere terror of her
presence, I give you my honour—I am
indeed.”</p>

<p>In one respect George’s prognostications
were correct. Belle made Betty her
<i>confidante</i>. She went over to see her
daily, to “chota hazree” or tiffin or tea—always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
at hours when the master of the
house was at Cutcherry. She liked to
turn over Betty’s dresses, to unburthen
her mind, and to drive out in the
Collector’s easy landau, and under the
wing of the Collector’s pretty niece worm
her way back into social importance.
(No one recognised an effort on Betty’s
part, and she only knew it herself, when
she realised what a relief it was to be
alone with her uncle.) This was the
bright side of the shield; it had its
reverse. It was hard to see a girl, who
had always been in the background, placed
above her, living in a luxurious home,
driving in London-built carriages, presiding
at splendid dinners, and attended
by obsequious and numerous chaprassies.
Luckily for her own peace, the new queen
gave herself no airs; she was as kind, as
generous, and as sympathetic as ever, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
on one subject she refused, fiercely refused,
to sympathise—<i>George</i>. She would never
listen to a word against him. Once she
turned a white resolute face on Belle, and
said very sternly:</p>

<p>“You say that he is an excellent
husband, nurses you when you are ill,
gives you everything you ask for, presses
you to buy new dresses, and to go to the
hills, has never begun a quarrel, never
gambles, drinks, or flirts; what do you
want?”</p>

<p>“He is all you say, but he is odd. He—only
to <i>you</i> would I tell this, Bet—”</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t, I won’t hear it!”
cried her companion passionately, and
putting her fingers up to her ears.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing bad,” screamed Belle,
pulling away one of her cousin’s hands.
“It is only this. George, I daresay,
likes me as well as most men like their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
wives, and he is far more polite and considerate
than one out of fifty, but I am
sure he has never been in love with me.
There is no harm in telling you what
is true. I cannot grumble, for I have
never been in love with him; we are
not really sympathetic. He is scrupulously
polite, and attentive and kind, but
he hates ‘Mossoo.’ I have heard him
<i>swear</i> at him, and he is so reserved and
undemonstrative. There is a veil across
his heart that I have never been able to
tear aside. He as good as told me once, that
he <i>had</i> liked some one—and once means
always with him, he is so pig-headed!
Oh, if I only knew who she had been,
or who she <i>is</i>,” and her eyes blazed
dangerously, “how I could hate her. I
suppose, Betty, you have no idea? You
know the Malones so intimately. Did
they ever drop a hint?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“Never,” she responded in a low, quiet
voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, well then I can’t make it out!
I should have thought you might have
known—you were such friends with that
odious little tell-tale Cuckoo—and that
if anyone could have told me, it would
have been <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>Betty was considered quite an acquisition
in the station (though, after its recent
experience, the station was somewhat
inclined to be coy in its reception of
fascinating strangers). True, she neither
sang nor acted, but she was pretty,
young, and bright, played the hostess
with surprising success, and rode well
forward with the Bobbery Pack on her
uncle’s well-known racing pony, “Leading
Article.”</p>

<p>She received friendly advice about her
health, and her ayah, and the necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
precautions to preserve her clothes, and
her complexion, in the spirit in which it
was meant, and was as popular as her
cousin was the reverse.</p>

<p>Strange to say—or perhaps it was not
very strange—she rarely saw George
Holroyd save in the distance at polo or
gymkhanas. In three months’ time they
had not exchanged three sentences. He
was as distant, and as formal, as if
they had never met before, and she was
secretly hurt to notice that he avoided
her purposely. But he could not avoid
her on that miserable occasion, when she
came to a dinner, given in her honour,
at his own house.</p>

<p>The guests were twelve in number,
and included, besides the Redmonds,
Captain La Touche, the Calverts, and
Miss Gay, also the Judge and Mrs. Pope—the
latter, an elderly lady, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
generous face and fine head, a woman
good to know and look at, a woman to
be relied on, and whose heart was so
large that she could even spare a morsel
for “poor queer Mrs. Holroyd.” The
table was prettily decorated (by Betty),
and there was no unfortunate mistake
about the Chartreuse <i>this</i> time, but it
was not a pleasant entertainment; the
hostess was in a bad temper, the “plats”
were abominable. Mr. Redmond was unusually
“gritty”; to be frank, the Collector
liked his dinner, he had had a
long day at Cutcherry, and he was hungry,
but this was dog’s food—“rateeb.”</p>

<p>Belle, with a touch of rouge on her
cheeks and a feverish sparkle in her eyes,
talked and laughed incessantly, with an
occasional fierce aside to the servants, and
a deadly thrust at her husband. She
had strung up her nerves with a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
dose of sal-volatile, and her sallies
spared no one.</p>

<p>Poor George! Was he happy with
the wrong woman at the head of the
table, and the right woman on his left
hand?</p>

<p>“George,” screamed the former, “just
look at that wretch, he is handing round
port instead of claret. He has given
Miss Gay port and soda water, but <i>you</i>
don’t mind what they do, nor help me
one bit; as long as you can smoke and
shoot, <i>you</i> are satisfied!”</p>

<p>During this agreeable speech everyone
commenced to talk with feverish animation,
so as to drown Mrs. Holroyd’s shrill
voice. When the port was carefully and
properly handed round, she began again:</p>

<p>“Betty,” she exclaimed, “don’t you
think George has become very quiet?
I notice that you and he have hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
opened your lips; is he not silent to
what he used to be?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, like the parrot, he <i>thinks</i>
the more,” growled Mr. Redmond, figuratively
drawing his sword.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, and like the parrot I
shall have to give him a red chili to
make him talk,” rejoined Belle smartly.</p>

<p>“He could not be in better hands,”
retorted the Collector, “no one so capable
as Mrs. Holroyd, of giving him something
<i>hot</i>.”</p>

<p>Belle affected not to hear this pleasantry,
and, turning to Captain La
Touche, said abruptly:</p>

<p>“What is that French riddle you have
just given Miss Gay?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a mere bagatelle. I will give you
one for yourself if you care to guess it.”</p>

<p>“I delight in French riddles, you
know I am half French!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Then listen to this,” counting on his
plump white fingers.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Et mon tout c’est le bonheur suprême.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I give it up,” said Belle, after several
ineffectual guesses, “although I am generally
very good at them, and at all
conundrums. It sounds rather odd. Is
it quite <i>proper</i>?”</p>

<p>“Proper! My dear madam, the
answer speaks for itself; the word is
<i>Mariage</i>.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Yes, yes, I see, not at all bad,” she
exclaimed condescendingly, but she did
not demand another French riddle; there
had been a disagreeable significance in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Mr. Redmond’s expression, as he repeated
“Mon tout c’est le diable lui-même.”
“Talking of marriages,” she said, “I hear
there is an end of Miss Lightwood’s
engagement to Captain Holster of the
Pink Inexpressibles. Mr. Proudfoot told
me, you know the horrible way he talks.
He said that the regiment had headed
him off, and that she was not ‘classy’
enough, or up to the form of the corps.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is the first I have heard
of it,” returned Captain La Touche with
some animation.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see you are delighted! Your
eyes twinkle at the news, you horrid
selfish bachelor; if you had your way, no
officer would marry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Mrs. Holroyd, you
must not give me such a character.”</p>

<p>“But I must! I believe you think
there ought to be a sort of committee on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
every girl before a comrade is allowed to
propose to her. I wonder if you would
have passed <i>me</i>? You don’t answer;
then I shall take silence for consent?”</p>

<p>“Such a novel suggestion took my
breath away, and deprived me for the
moment of the power of speech. I am
dumb, simply because the question is so
utterly superfluous.”</p>

<p>Belle smiled and tittered, accepting this
double-edged compliment entirely from
Lord Chesterfield’s point of view, and then
addressed herself to her other neighbour.
She had already heard him, at an early
period in the feast, saying to his servant,
as he gave his plate an impatient push:</p>

<p>“Here! take this away; get me some
dry toast,” and now he was turning and
re-turning his pudding with a palpably
scornful spoon! As she watched him
she felt her heart grow hot within her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“I am afraid you have no appetite,”
she observed in her sharpest key. “I
<i>thought</i> you were looking rather yellow
and out of sorts.”</p>

<p>“Never felt better in my life, hungry
as a hunter; but, my dear madam, <i>what</i>
is this new dish? Did you make it
yourself?”</p>

<p>“A <i>vol au vent</i> of plantains, you dreadful
<i>bon vivant</i>. Is it true that your first
question every morning is, to ask how the
wind is, to see if your club mutton may
hang a day longer?”</p>

<p>“A base libel, an invention of the
enemy,” he returned emphatically; and,
so saying, he seized his glass, dashed a
quantity of sherry into his plate, and
hastily gulped down its contents. Then,
as he caught the fiery eye of his hostess,
he saw that she was working herself
into a frame of mind that might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
troublesome, and said with his blandest
air:</p>

<p>“I notice that you have a pair of fine
new pictures,” screwing his glass into his
eye. “I have not seen them before.”</p>

<p>“Yes—I picked them up at an auction,
and I am rather proud of my
purchase, though George there,” with a
withering glance at her husband, “says
that the Alps by moonlight might be
taken for some haystacks round a puddle,
and that lovely sunset at sea, for a dish
of eggs and bacon. Now tell me your
opinion of them frankly; for I believe
you <i>do</i> know something about art!”</p>

<p>“As well as I can judge from this distance,
and, in fact, not being much of a
judge at any distance, I should say that
these pictures are oil paintings of some
notoriety. And in fact, rather remarkable
productions. I give you my word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of honour I have not seen anything <i>like</i>
them for a long time; you have secured
something quite out of the common——”</p>

<p>“Ah, really,” looking steadfastly into
his grave, impassive face. “Well then,
since I have had your opinion, I shall
promote them to the drawing-room in
future. I shall promote <i>myself</i> there now.”</p>

<p>And presently she and her lady guests
arose and departed. When the gentlemen
rejoined the rest of the company, there
was the usual after-dinner music. Belle
opened the concert with a sparkling little
ballad, and Betty played one of Scharwenker’s
wild, weird Polish dances, that
seemed to set every one thinking of their
past. Miss Gay sang by special request
“Forever and Forever.” As her rich and
sympathetic voice rang through the room,
with its too appropriate words, Betty bent
her face over a book of photographs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
never once raised it. Her head ached, she
was nervous and constrained, and despite
her subsequent efforts to be gay and
conversational, more than one remarked
“that pretty Miss Redmond seemed pale
and out of spirits.” She was most
thankful when Mrs. Pope rose, and gave
the signal for her own release. She had
been figuratively on the rack all that
miserable evening. The exposé of George’s
wretched home wrung her very heart. If
Belle had made him happy, if there had
been no shame for her in her thoughts,
no pity for him, it would have been different,
oh! so very different. She would
not—she was sure—have felt this dreadful
tightness in her throat, and this insane
impulse to burst out crying. The worn-looking,
grave young man who escorted
her down the hall, but did not offer to
put on her cloak, could he be the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
George Holroyd that used to take her
and Cuckoo out schooling through the
fields behind Bridgetstown, and make the
keen wintry air ring with his cheery
laugh?</p>

<p>“Well, George! How do you think
it went off?” enquired Belle, when the
last guest had taken a peg, a cheroot,
and his departure, and she threw herself
yawning into a chair.</p>

<p>George stood with his hands in his
pockets, and looked intently at his boots,
and made no reply.</p>

<p>“I think every one enjoyed themselves:
it was quite a success. How do you think
Betty was looking?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as usual,” without raising his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t admire her, I
know; she was pale to-night, but maybe
that was her dress; pink does not suit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
Betty. Mrs. Pope has taken such a fancy
to her.”</p>

<p>“Has she?”</p>

<p>“She is nearly as enthusiastic as Sally
Dopping; she thinks Betty is so pretty,
and interesting-looking! And what <i>do</i>
you think the funny old woman says?
She declares that Betty has a story in
her eyes.”</p>

<p>“A what? A sty in her eye?”</p>

<p>“A <i>story</i> in her eyes! Isn’t it a preposterous
idea? I asked her what she
meant, and she nodded and smiled in
that exaggerated way of hers and said:
‘I am sure I am right, ask her to <i>tell</i> it
to you, my dear!’ It was on the tip
of my tongue to say, that <i>she</i> had a
story in her mouth, for you know as
well as I do, that Betty never cared for
anyone in her life in that way; a story
in her eyes indeed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>As Mr. Redmond and his niece walked
home, with a lantern carried before them
as a precaution against snakes, he said:
“Thank goodness that’s over and we
need not go again. Betty, is there any
cold meat in the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, cold corned beef, a nice hump.”</p>

<p>“Good! What a dinner! What courage
Holroyd had to marry that woman;
he ought to be decorated with a V. C.
What a temper she has.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s rather hot certainly.”</p>

<p>“Hot is no name for it. Holroyd acts
as a sort of fire-engine between her and
the station. Poor chap! I often see his
eyes fixed on her at dinners with a sort
of desperate apprehension as to what
she will say <i>next</i>! I wonder what possessed
Holroyd to marry her. Do you
know?”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“She is not young, she has no money,
her looks are going. She can talk, I
grant you! It is a pity that such power
of utterance is not united to more intelligence;
in many ways she is an absolute
fool.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Uncle Bernard, indeed she
is not,” protested his companion. “She
may not be what you would call intellectual,
but she is very bright, she has
plenty of sense.”</p>

<p>“If she has sense then heaven help
those who have none. Well—well—she
always rubs <i>me</i> up the wrong way. I
don’t believe she has an ounce of brains,
but you think differently, and we won’t
fall out. We will never fall out, you and
I, Bet! You are an amiable girl, and
make allowances for everyone, and can be
happy and at ease even with that woman
in the next compound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>But what, oh most learned yet ignorant
Collector! what about the <i>man</i> in the
next compound?</p>

<p>George Holroyd avoided the ladies’ room
in the Club, the groups of ladies under
the trees outside; he did not play tennis,
and, owing to his wife’s mourning, he
was not on duty at dances; therefore he
and Betty rarely met, unless they came
across one another out hunting.</p>

<p>On these matchless Indian mornings and
evenings, when they drew the brakes and
nullahs, and found; when there was a
sound of horn and a rush and clatter of
hoofs among the long grass and cane
stubble, away over the plains, scattering
dust and sand on the bye-roads, away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
away after the wiry little grey fox with
his black-tipped brush, and the fleeting,
irregular pack of all sorts and conditions
of dogs, Polygars, Rampore hounds,
pariahs and fox terriers. Through the
fields, scattering the cattle, through the
woods, startling the fruit watchers, through
shallow rivers, rousing the submerged
water buffaloes. How good it is to be
young, with every pulse throbbing, every
nerve straining, away to where a little
cloud of dust and a momentary scuffle,
betoken a kill in the open.</p>

<p>Tippoo and Sultan, the long-legged
Polygars, have overtaken and slain the
fox. Poor Mr. Fox! You will never
see your little family again, will never
again bring them home a tender guinea
fowl, or a fat pea chick; they will sit at
the sunny side of the bamboo clump and
watch for your return in vain. Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
thick, black-tipped brush hangs at Miss
Redmond’s saddle-bow, as she turns homewards,
leading the van, charging through
melon-fields, scouring over tracts of sands,
jumping nullahs, fording rivers. But Mr.
Holroyd, who was well to the front
during the run, now reins in his hot-tempered
Australian and lags conspicuously
in the rear—Why? Only he
and Betty knew the reason.</p>

<p>About six weeks before Christmas Mr.
Redmond went out into camp for what
is called the “cold weather tour.” It is
a Collector’s duty to visit his tahsils or
out-stations, and examine the general condition
of his district, receive petitions and
inspect tracts affected by flood or famine;
it is thus that he sees the result of his
previous six months’ government. Mr.
Redmond departed from Mangobad, with
the usual pomp and imposing train of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
camels, tents, horses and elephants, and
Betty accompanied him. It was all new
to her—a delightful novel life, and a
blessed relief from the painful strain of
her daily existence in cantonments, where
the vicinity of George, and the perpetual
presence of Belle was—only to her inmost
thoughts did she whisper it—becoming
insupportable. She enjoyed the
change and complete freedom; the glories
of a tropical dawn; the early marches
through strange surroundings; the halts
in the mango topes; the keen exhilarating
air, and at night the great wood fires.
She was left a good deal to herself, and
this she enjoyed also, whilst her uncle
conferred with his sleek serishtadars,
received thousands of petitions, and
dallies! strings of evil-smelling yellow
marigolds, and sweet pink roses, and
many visits from native gentlemen, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
elephants or in palanquins. During these
solitary hours, she read, or worked, or wandered
about the adjacent jungle, in company
with her own thoughts. Truly
nature is a great physician of souls!
The peace of the place descended into
her heart, and soothed and hushed its
repinings, as she drank in the exquisite
atmosphere, the living silence of the
jungle, broken only by the sound of her
own footsteps, as she strolled beneath
the Kuchnar, and sweet-smelling cork
trees—treading tenderly on their fallen,
withering flowers. She determined to
be brave, to shut her eyes to the past,
to make the best of the present, and of
the new life that lay before her. She
was only twenty, and she would not
permit one misfortune to shadow all her
days. She was resolved to make a second
start, but she did not want a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
lover. No! Although she assured herself
emphatically that she had now no
other feeling for George than sisterly
affection, and intense pity, she meant
to figuratively lock up her heart and
throw away the key. She would not,
and could not, bestow it on Mr. Hammond,
Mr. Redmond’s friend—clever,
agreeable, and popular as he was. No,
nor on Captain La Touche, nor yet on
Mr. Proudfoot. She would be her uncle’s
life-long companion, she would bury the
past, she would bear with Belle, and
would think more of others and less of
herself, and her own troubles. These,
and many other good resolutions, came
flocking round her as she strolled about
the camp by day, or sat outside the tents—whilst
Mr. Redmond dozed in his
chair—staring into the big red fire in
the still, cool night—a stillness only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
broken by the baying of pariah dogs in
distant villages, the howl of the hungry,
melancholy jackal, the shouts of the
watchers in the fields scaring wild beasts
from the crops of sugar-cane, bajra and
jowar. But life was not always quiet
and solitary. When the camp happened
to be within a reasonable distance, many
well-known faces from Mangobad surrounded
the great, blazing logs, and
many familiar voices broke the usual
majestic silence.</p>

<p>The hospitable Collector invited out
most of his friends, and Betty asked Mrs.
Holroyd, but she remained only two days.
She detested rural life, and so did “Mossoo.”
She hated the spear grass that
got into her petticoats and stockings,
suspected snakes under every chair, and
became hysterical on an elephant. She
longed for her own safe fireside, her book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
and her arm-chair. Her husband had
declined altogether, pleading duty. But
one evening Mr. Redmond came across
Captain La Touche and him, out shooting,
and absolutely refused to take nay—it
was Christmas Eve—he had at least
twenty guests—he intended to have
twenty-two—Mrs. Holroyd was in Lucknow,
and Mr. Holroyd had not the
ghost of an excuse! There was a grand
Christmas dinner—with pretty Indian
jungle decorations, real English plum-pudding,
a monster turkey, and plenty
of crackers, and good wishes. Afterwards
the company set out in the moonlight
to explore the camp, and visit the
elephants and horses, before assembling
around the great log fire to drink punch
or mulled port, and play games. The
night was clear and cold; and wrapped
in a long red fur-lined cloak, Betty strolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
now with one guest, now another, and
finally found herself pacing the short dry
grass—beyond the tents, with her uncle
and George Holroyd! It was a magnificent
Eastern night—such a night as
entitles India to be called the land of the
moon, as well as the land of the sun.
The scene was almost as bright as day,
and almost as still as death. Behind the
Collector lay his snow-white camp beneath
the mango trees—before him, a plateau,
on the edge of which a mosque-shaped
tomb stood out in dark relief against the
sky—beyond the tomb, a wide plain,
stretching away to the horizon, a rich
cultivated tract, unbroken by aught save
an occasional clump of sugar-cane, an
occasional reedy jheel, with its fringe of
waving water plants, and here and there,
a great single forest tree.</p>

<p>“How quiet it is out here,” said Betty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
“there is not a sound save the nightjar.
I quite miss the bugles at Mangobad.”</p>

<p>“Can you distinguish them?” enquired
George.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I can—except that
one that seems to say, ‘come home—come
home—come home.’”</p>

<p>“The last post,” explained her uncle.
“I know them all down to the advance,
ending in three C’s. How many a gallant
fellow <i>it</i> has cost us! Did you get
any snipe to-day, Holroyd?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but only four brace.”</p>

<p>“I went out yesterday, myself, to a
most lovely spot, an ideal home for a
snipe, and never saw a feather! Just a
nice cover; nice feeding-ground. If I
were a snipe, I would go and settle there
at once, and take my family with me.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that I see people ploughing
at this hour, uncle?” interrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Betty. “Six ploughs—beyond that brown
patch.”</p>

<p>“Very possible! In the indigo season,
it’s a common thing for them to plough
all night. I suppose it is ten o’clock
now. That reminds me that I have business
with my sheristadar, and I must be
going back, but you, Betty, need not
come. Take Holroyd on and show him
the tomb, it’s rather old and curious,”
and turning quickly on his heel he left
them abruptly; left them to their first
<i>tête-à-tête</i> since they had parted that July
day in the avenue at Noone.</p>

<p>“I must congratulate you on getting
your company,” said Betty as they
walked on together. “I heard the news
just before dinner—I am so glad.”</p>

<p>Glad she might be, but she could
scarcely command her voice. Oh, why
had Uncle Bernard left them? left her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
without a pretence of escape. She must
make the best of the situation, and summon
all her self-possession and all her woman’s
wit, to keep clear of one topic.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Yes, everything comes
to those who wait.”</p>

<p>“Belle will be delighted,” she ventured
in a sort of panic, fearing that if she
stopped talking he would commence on
that subject.</p>

<p>“Yes,” and he added with somewhat
dreary levity, “she does not care about
being ‘a subaltern’s poor thing.’” A
long pause, during which their own footsteps
on the baked, dry grass, was the
only sound.</p>

<p>“I had a letter from Cuckoo last mail,”
continued the girl, making a valiant effort
to keep up the conversation; anything,
anything, but this dead suggestive silence.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I had one from my mother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Denis is coming home. He cannot get
any congenial employment, and he and
Lizzie don’t seem to hit it off.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear it, but these hasty
marriages do not often turn out well.”
She halted abruptly—her companion’s own
marriage had been a hasty one—and then
plunged into another subject.</p>

<p>“I saw you and uncle discussing something
very serious this evening before
dinner. When uncle nods his head, and
walks with his hands behind him, I know
he is talking of something interesting and
important.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are quite right. He was
talking of <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“Of me?” with a sort of breathless
gasp.</p>

<p>“He has got some wild idea that I
have influence with you, and he asked
me, as an old and entirely disinterested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
friend—not likely to have a woman’s love
of match-making—to speak to you about
Mr. Hammond.”</p>

<p>“To speak to me about Mr. Hammond!
I am utterly sick of hearing about
Mr. Hammond. Uncle, Mrs. Pope, Mrs.
Calvert, can talk of nothing else.”</p>

<p>“He is not young, but he is not old,”
continued George, “he is a remarkably
able man, he will be in Council some
day, he is an honourable upright gentleman.
I quote your uncle’s words exactly,
and your uncle, although he cannot bear
to lose you, says that Hammond is his
personal friend, and he does not wish to
stand in the way of your making a good
match, and he asked me to speak to you,
as an old acquaintance, and to beg you
to think it over. Think of your carriages,
and diamonds, think of all the
ladies old enough to be your mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
who must walk behind you into a room.
Think.” They had now reached the tomb
and were standing at its horse-shoe
shaped entrance. He stopped abruptly,
and leaning his shoulder against the wall
behind him, looked hard at his companion.</p>

<p>“Does it not seem strange,” he went
on in a totally altered voice, “that such
a mission should be entrusted to <i>me</i>—of
all men living?”</p>

<p>Betty affected not to notice the change
in his manner, and said with her calmest
air, and in a firm tone:</p>

<p>“I like Mr. Hammond immensely as a
friend, but he is thirty years older than
I am, and I do not choose——”</p>

<p>“To be an old man’s darling!” supplemented
her companion sharply.</p>

<p>“No—I was going to say, change my
estate. I am very happy as I am,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
lifting her eyes from the moonlit plain,
and looking straight and full at her
questioner.</p>

<p>“Yet I don’t mind betting that before
very long you will disappear from Mangobad
amid a cloud of rice, and with the
inevitable slipper on the top of the
carriage. Proudfoot is not so ancient.”</p>

<p>Mr. Proudfoot was a handsome and
superlatively conceited young man—(his
conceit probably the result of an uncriticised
career)—who played the banjo,
and sang sweetly, and constantly assured
his lady friends that he had been <i>such</i>
a pretty boy. He paid Betty conspicuous
attention, and was at this
moment eagerly searching for her in
every direction, but she and her companion
were standing on the far side of
the mosque steps, and its substantial walls
were between them and the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I tell you a secret?” said Betty
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Do,” he returned with a slight start,
but recovering himself instantly.</p>

<p>“I cannot endure the Golden Butterfly”
(Mr. Proudfoot’s nickname).</p>

<p>“Why—what has he done? Has
anyone told you anything?”</p>

<p>“He has told me everything himself,”
she returned with a smile into the grave
face beside her. “He dined with us,
one evening; we had the Trotters to
dinner too, and he confided to me, as we
sat behind the piano, that when he was
at home—I must try and quote his own
words as you did uncle’s—he met Mrs.
Trotter in the Park, and she came bustling
up to him; ‘for the life of me,’ he
said, ‘I could not remember her name,
though I remembered her face and
dinners, for when I was at that hole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Sonapore, she was there, and I used to
be in and out a good deal. But by
George! Sonapore is one place, and
London is another, one does not come
home to see one’s <i>Indian</i> friends, eh?
I was not going to allow her to fasten
herself on to me, and such a dowdy too!
So I just took off my hat, and walked
on—cut her so to speak, and now, <i>she</i>
cuts me!’ What do you think of such a
nice, grateful, gentlemanly young man?”</p>

<p>“I am not surprised—my opinion of
him remains unchanged; but he still
seems to find favour in <i>your</i> eyes—he sat
beside you at dinner and appeared to make
himself agreeable.”</p>

<p>“He bored me to death, about society
at home, and his clubs.”</p>

<p>“Clubs! I don’t believe he ever belonged
to one in his life, except a <i>Mutton
Club</i>”—remarked Captain Holroyd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
scornfully. A ghurree in the camp now
struck ten, and turning to her abruptly, he
said in a voice that made her heart stand
still:</p>

<p>“Betty, let us drop this hideous farce
for five minutes, this Christmas night,
and speak plainly to one another, face
to face. I wonder that you look at me,
much less talk and laugh with me,
when I know what you think of me at
the bottom of your heart. Wait”—seeing
that she was about to speak—“I
never was so astonished, as when I saw
you on our own steps. I had not a
suspicion that you were coming out.
Had I known, I would have got an
exchange; got leave, got <i>anything</i>, that
would have taken me out of the station,
and out of your sight, and you actually
offered me your hand—but some women
are angels!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“I am no angel,” returned Betty
almost inaudibly, “far from it. Do not
let us speak of the past, it is done with,
it is dead. There is no reason why we
should not be friends.”</p>

<p>“Then, Betty,” he exclaimed, looking
at her keenly, “<i>you know</i>?”</p>

<p>Betty did not speak; she turned away
her face, and gazed over the great far-stretching
landscape, bathed in moonlight;
she saw nothing of its placid
beauty, for her eyes were dimmed with
tears.</p>

<p>“Answer me,” he insisted.</p>

<p>She bowed her head without looking
towards him.</p>

<p>“Who told you?” he asked after an
appreciable silence.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Redmond,” she replied in a
choked voice. “She gave me your letter
to her, before she died.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“Betty, did I—did she—nearly break
your heart?”</p>

<p>“It is all over now,” she returned in
a low voice.</p>

<p>“Abominable old woman! As long as
I draw breath I shall never forgive her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, George, do not say that; you
must forgive her, you will forgive her.
I have done so long ago. It is all over,
and done with <i>now</i>, for ever.” As she
spoke her sweet firm lips were set in a
line that was almost stern.</p>

<p>“Over and done with for you—never
over for me. But why should I expect
you to care? the past, as you say, is
dead, dead and buried. However, it is
some comfort to me, to hear that you know
that I was not a heartless scoundrel.”</p>

<p>“I never thought that,” she returned
with a tremor in her voice.</p>

<p>“And I, miserable fool, never doubted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
a line of Mrs. Redmond’s letter. I
accepted it all with unquestioning conviction.
I knew that Moore was in love
with you, and as you were lost to me I
married Belle. Belle, who came out to
be my wife in all good faith, believing
that I loved her, and assuring me of her
own attachment. She was your cousin.
She was homeless and friendless in this
country, and totally unsuspicious of her
mother’s crime—for it <i>was</i> a crime—I
could not send her back, shamed and
slighted, to Ballingoole. I did what I
believed any man of honour would do—I
married her. I did not care what became
of the rest of my life—and I gave
it to her, no great gift!—and I honestly
meant to make the best of things for
her sake—but oh—my God—!” he exclaimed
hoarsely—“if I had only known
the truth!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Betty listened, with white parted lips,
and then said in a low voice: “And
<i>she</i> must never know.”</p>

<p>“No—of course not. I am glad I
had this chance of speaking to you at
last, and thankful for what you tell me—to
hear that you knew the truth—to
know that you did not feel——”</p>

<p>“Not feel,” she echoed with a start,
and a thrill in her voice. “George, I
too will speak, just once—and never
again. It cannot be wrong to tell you
now—that it did nearly break my heart,
it was so unexpected, so sudden, and I
was—” she was about to add “so fond
of you,” but looking into her companion’s
penetrating dark eyes, she faltered—“I
could tell no one—I had to bear it alone—no
one knows—no one ever will know,
only you and me! But I could not
let you suppose that I did not feel—and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
George, as it is all over now—as it was
not to be—let us not be cowards.”</p>

<p>“No,” he interrupted fiercely. “Once
I was going to shoot myself, but you
see I thought better of it.”</p>

<p>“Let us not be cowards,” she repeated
with quivering lips. “Let us make the
very most of our lives, and try and make
other people happy. When I hear of
you doing something good and noble,
that will be <i>my</i> happiness.”</p>

<p>Tears were very near the beautiful
eyes, that looked with sad wistfulness
into his.</p>

<p>“And when I hear of your marriage
with some wealthy Civilian,” he sneered,
“I suppose that is to be <i>mine</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh! George,” she exclaimed, with
two large tears now trickling down her
face, “don’t talk in that way. It is not
like you! You once told me that a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
could be whatever he willed—man is man
and master of his fate—you are still the
master of yours.”</p>

<p>“My fate was too strong for me!
Mrs. Redmond herself, like one of those
ancient witches, cut it across with a pair
of shears. It is not her fault, that I
have not gone to the devil. I believe I
shall get there yet.”</p>

<p>“No, you are only saying this to
frighten me, and I am not afraid. You
will make the best of your life. You
will forgive and forget.”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Yes—I know you better than you do
yourself although you <i>are</i> so changed!”
the last words came in a kind of sob.</p>

<p>“Changed!” he echoed with sudden
compunction. “Yes, but not so changed
as to behave like a brute to you! Forgive
me, Betty—I will—I do—try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
forgive, but I shall not try to forget. I
will shake off, if I can, the sort of deadly
paralysis that comes over me—I shall
volunteer for our next little war. As
for you, whatever good luck you have”—and
he gulped down something in his
throat—“no matter in what shape it
comes—and whatever happiness may fall
into your life—it will be good fortune
and happiness for me. Betty, do you
remember Juggy at the gate lodge?
She said you had a lucky face! And
I have a strong presentiment that you
were not born to trouble, but that you
have many bright days in store for you
somewhere. As for myself——”</p>

<p>He paused, for Mr. Proudfoot, still
searching, had suddenly turned the corner
of the tomb, and stood within three yards
of him. It was almost on that young
man’s lips to say “I beg your pardon,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
for Holroyd was as white as death, and
Miss Redmond had been crying. Yes,
she had actually her handkerchief in her
hand, although she exclaimed, with wonderful
composure, “Oh, Mr. Proudfoot, I
am quite ready. I suppose uncle has
sent you to look for me. I had no idea
it was so late. I must go back at once,”
and she hurried down the steps, accompanied
by the two men. Half way to
camp, they encountered Mr. Redmond,
who called out in his loud, cheery
voice:</p>

<p>“Well, Holroyd, what do you think
of the tomb? Rather fine, is it not?
They say it was built by Jahangir.”
Holroyd muttered something inarticulate.
Neither he nor Betty had cast one single
glance at the object of their walk. They
might as well have been standing beside
a blank wall, for all the interest they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
had taken in this tomb, which was one
of the sights of the district.</p>

<p>Betty went straight to her tent, and
was seen no more that evening, and
George departed from the camp at daybreak.
The reason of this sudden move
was explained by Mr. Proudfoot in the
strictest confidence to some half-dozen
listeners:</p>

<p>“Holroyd and Miss Redmond had had
no end of a shindy, and he had walked
into the thick of it behind the big tomb—no
doubt that little devil Mrs. Holroyd
had made some mischief between them.”</p>

<p>With the first appearance of punkhas,
and the first “notice about ice” most of
the people at Mangobad fled away to
Simla, Mussoorie, or Naini-Tal—chiefly
to Naini-Tal. Mr. Redmond’s face was
an amusing study (in black) when Belle
suggested in her most kittenish and effusive
manner, that “she should share a
house with him, as George could only get
two months’ leave, and that it would
be great fun to live together!” but Mr.
Redmond grimly declined this unalluring
proposition in a few brief words, and
subsequently (purposely) took a mansion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
that set the whole length of the lake, and
a distance of two miles, between his
abode and Mrs. Holroyd’s cheap, damp,
out-of-the-way little bungalow—for Belle
was now nothing if not economical, and
thrifty, to the verge of parsimony, save
in the matter of her personal adornment.
Naini-Tal, named after the goddess Naini
(or Nynee), is a lake that lies six thousand
feet above the plains, in the lap
of the Himalayas; the surrounding hills
rise from the edge of the water and are
covered with houses half hidden among
trees. These houses are reached by
narrow paths, in some instances goat
tracks, and the only means of locomotion
is either on a pony’s back, or in a jhampan
or dandy, carried on the shoulders
of four men. A jhampan—the gondola
of the hills—is something between a chair
and a coffin, and, to an uneducated eye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the first glimpse of Naini-Tal, with its
crowds of people being borne along,
suggests the victims of some frightful
colliery or railway accident. But a nearer
inspection shows smartly dressed ladies,
reclining in gaily painted dandies, and
borne by jhampannies in gorgeous liveries.
Each memsahib dresses her bearers brilliantly,
and racks her brains to devise some
novelty that will distinguish her from
the rest of her neighbours! You can
descry her while she is yet afar off. You
know where she is calling, and where she
is shopping, when you see her blazing
team squatting outside—with the surreptitious
<i>huka</i>—awaiting her reappearance.
Now you meet a green and yellow set,
next a scarlet and blue, after that, an
orange and crimson, jostling others who
are all orange. What burlesques of family
liveries! What travesties of monograms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
emblazoned on the bearers’ broad chests!
Naini-Tal is a pretty place, especially by
moonlight, or when the surrounding hills
are reflected in the lake. It is in the
shape of a cup, or a great extinct crater,
and you have to climb a thousand feet
to get a view of the line of everlasting
snows, commanded, as it were, by Nunga-Devi,
the “Storm Goddess,” standing out
sternly against the steel-blue sky. The
only flat space is the Mall round the
lake, and the polo ground. There are
lovely walks, if you do not object to
stiff climbing, and once arrived you find
yourself, as it were, lost in the woods,
among moss and rocks and overhanging
trees with thick fringes of ferns covering
their outspread branches. Here you get
a peep of the lake—there of the distant
blue plains. True, these walks have some
drawbacks. They are excessively slippery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
in damp weather, and panthers lie in
wait for dogs (and are particularly partial
to fox terriers), moreover, greedy leeches
accompany the unsuspecting pedestrian to
his, or her, own house. Naini-Tal is
gay! What popular hill station is not?
Balls, races—yes, races—regattas, and
picnics; theatricals, tableaux, and concerts
all succeed one another in rapid
succession, and when early in May new
arrivals come swarming up from the
plains, the hotels are crammed, and every
day half-a-dozen new sets of jhampannies,
carrying a new memsahib, appear on the
Mall, and dozens of gallant sahibs come
cantering up from the Brewery, with a
syce clinging to their ponies’ tails, who
would believe in that terrible story about
Friday, the 18th September, 1880, when,
after two days’ torrents of rain, during
which everyone was a prisoner to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
house, and cut off from their neighbours,
there was a hollow rumble—then arose
a red, dusty cloud, like fire, and when
that cloud had dispersed, and the mist had
lifted, the Assembly Rooms, the Victoria
Hotel, and several houses had been effaced—swept
away and engulfed in a moment,
and with them a hundred souls. There
are occasional little landslips during the
monsoon. Rocks come thundering down,
tons of earth crumble off, the cart road
“goes” annually, but on the whole
Naini-Tal is considered as safe as its
neighbours. High up on a hill among
rocks and trees, in a somewhat inaccessible
spot, you come across a board
on which is painted, “Captain Holroyd,
Royal Musketeers,” and near it a box for
visitors’ cards (which is almost always
empty). If you follow the path, you
arrive at a dreary-looking, one-storeyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
house, with no view, and the reputation
of being very damp, and of having a
family of needy panthers among the surrounding
rocks. If you penetrated to
the drawing-room, the chances are ten to
one that you would find Belle cowering
over the fire with a shawl on her shoulders
and “Mossoo” in her lap, and two
to one in a bad temper—both mistress
and dog alike victims to ennui. “She
was no one up here,” she grumbled to
Betty every time she saw her. “<i>She</i>
was a Collector’s niece, and asked out to
big dinners every night, and taken to
picnics up Diopatha and Iopatha, or
down to Douglas Dale, but of course that
was partly because Mr. Redmond entertained!
<i>She</i> did not (and so much the
better for Naini-Tal). They had got up
theatricals—people that knew nothing
about them, that could not act one little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
bit, and they had never even consulted
her, or asked her to take a part. Of
course that was all jealousy, and pitifully
transparent! They had heard of her
acting at Lucknow, and Mangobad, and
seen the account of it in the papers, and
were afraid of her cutting them all out.
Her reputation had come up before her
(it had indeed), and George said it was
too soon after her mother’s death to go
to balls—George was so peculiar,” and so
on, in the same strain for about an hour.
Belle arrayed her jhampannies in the
smartest suits in the station, and excited
quite a sensation as she was carried
triumphantly along the Mall. But alas!
She had only the clothes now, and no
<i>men</i> to wear them; and without jhampannies
a lady is comparatively a prisoner.
As a class, these sturdy, jovial, brown hill
men are most independent; give them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
wood tickets, their mornings to themselves,
and no late hours, and no heavy
passengers—give them smart suits and
caps, and warm blankets, and they will
take you out once or—peradventure at
a pinch—twice a day, without grumbling.
But when a lady, be she ever so light,
is always calling for them and harrying
them, when she takes them long and
steep paths to pay needless visits, and
beats them with her parasol, why they
figuratively snap their fingers at her and
go!—and what is worse, they boycott
her in the bazaars. Belle was in a bad
plight; she could only join the giddy
throng below at the Assembly Rooms, or
round the lake, and polo ground, when
she could obtain coolies at double fare!</p>

<p>On these days, smartly dressed in what
<i>she</i> called second mourning, she descended
and paraded the Mall with Betty, went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
out in a wherry with George, had tea and
ices at Morrison’s shop and enjoyed herself
considerably, forgetting for the time
her woes, her hateful servants, and her
dismal, murky house.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the lake, in a
good situation, you come upon a fine two-storeyed
abode, with Mr. Redmond’s name
on the gate board and Miss Redmond’s
box full of cards. He was popular, despite
his eccentricities; everyone knew that
if his bark was loud, his bite was nil;
and Betty was much admired as she rode
along the Mall and walked on the “Berm”
between rows of discriminating British
subalterns, sitting on the rails arrayed in
boating flannels and gorgeous “blazers.”
She was in constant request, as Belle had
complained, but gave up many a pleasant
engagement (to boat, to ride, to play
tennis) to climb that weary hill, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
sit with that querulous, discontented little
creature; who imperatively demanded her
visits, and yet when she came, never
ceased to scold her sharply for her dress,
her friends, and her airs!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The monsoon broke with a violence
peculiar to the Himalayas, the rains descended,
and the floods came foaming down
the mountains, the same mountains and
the lake being swallowed up in mist, and
all but the most stout-hearted (and booted)
were prisoners to the house. Belle was
alone. She was laid up with fever, and
she wrote such a piteous scrawl, that
Betty, in spite of her uncle’s angry expostulation,
consented to go to her, and
cheer her up and stay a week! She
evolved some order in that cheerless home,
tidied up the drawing-room, put away
Belle’s old “chits” and papers, and scraps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
and “Mossoo’s” bones, coaxed some servants
into the empty godowns, for there
was not one on the premises, but a deaf
old ayah and a waterman. Belle enjoyed
the transformation and the company of a
bright companion, and was better, and out,
and gay. At the end of the week, George
returned from a signalling class at Ranikhet,
rode in quite unexpectedly, and
his arrival was an excuse for Betty’s
immediate departure, but Belle in vehement
language that almost bordered on
violent words, insisted that her cousin
must remain one day longer, in order to
be present at a little dinner party that
included Captain La Touche and a neighbouring
married couple. Her popular
cousin was her social trump card; moreover,
she looked to her to make the
sweets, and decorate the table.</p>

<p>But when the hour came, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
dressed, Belle felt too ill to appear. She
had got her feet wet. She had a cold,
and sore throat, and she was forced to
stay in her own room by the fire, and
dine in company with “Mossoo.”</p>

<p>She felt excessively irritable and ill-used,
as the sounds of merry laughing
and talking came from the adjoining
dining-room; <i>they</i> were having a very
good time, and she—how dull she felt!
She had no amusement, not even a book;
she rose and searched about for something
to read. She went, as a last resource,
into George’s dressing-room, but
there she could find no food for her
mind, save sundry Manuals of Infantry
Drill and of Field Exercises, and half
a dozen red-bound “Royal Warrants.”
She was turning disconsolately away,
when her eyes fell upon his <i>keys</i>. Of
these he was always so careful—so suspiciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
careful—and never left them
about. Happy thought! She could amuse
herself unusually well, in having a good
rummage through his dispatch box.
Perhaps she would discover some of his
secrets. A husband had no business to
have secrets from his wife; perhaps she
would discover something about what she
mentally called “the other girl.” With
this honourable intention she carried the
box into her own room, placed it on a
table near the fire, and sat herself deliberately
down before it. The key was
easily found, and as easily turned in the
lock; the lid was thrown open, and the
upper tray scrutinised. Nothing but a
cheque book, a banker’s book, some papers
and envelopes, and a Manual on Musketry.
In the lower compartment were some of
his mother’s letters, a packet of paid bills,
some recipes for dogs and horses, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the bottom of all a sealed parcel. She felt
it carefully. Yes—it contained a cabinet
photograph—<i>the</i> photograph; she must,
and would, see what the creature was
like.</p>

<p>In a second the cover was torn off.
But—but, who was this? holding it to
the lamp with a shaking hand.</p>

<p><i>Betty!</i></p>

<p>At first, she could not realise the full
extent of her discovery, she simply stared,
and panted, and trembled. It meant
nothing! Then her eye caught sight of
the other contents of the packet—a little
well-remembered brooch, a withered flower,
and a letter in her mother’s handwriting.</p>

<p>As she read this, her breast heaved
convulsively, the veins in her forehead
stood out like cords, her fingers twitched,
so that the paper between them rattled
and was torn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>When she had come to the very end
of it, she sat with her eyes fixed, her
hands to her head, as if she had received
a galvanic shock. “To think that all
along it was Betty, the hypocrite, the
viper, the wretch, that robbed me of my
husband’s love. Oh, how I hate her!
How I loathe her! How I wish she was
dead! I see it all—all now. She stole
him from me that time she went to the
Moores, and oh, how false she has been
ever since. How well they have kept
their secret. I shall never believe in any
one again, not in a saint from heaven.
And I, poor fool, asking if she <i>ever</i> had
a love affair! Oh, I could tear her
to pieces. I could, I could,” and she
gnashed her teeth, and clenched her
hands, and “Mossoo” fled into hiding
under a chest of drawers.</p>

<p>Not a thought of remorse for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
lives sacrificed for her, not a thought of
any one but herself, and her wrongs.</p>

<p><i>Now</i>, she saw why George avoided
Betty, at least, in public; now by the
light of her discovery she saw everything;
many puzzling circumstances were
as plain as A, B, C, and here, at this
present moment, that abominable girl was
under her roof, sitting in <i>her</i> place, and
entertaining her guests! Oh! Oh!
Oh! it was past all endurance, and she
began to pace the room almost at a run;
her fury rising like a gale at sundown.
She must wait (if she could) till those
people had gone; it was after eleven;
they must leave soon, and <i>then</i>——</p>

<p>It was a fearful night. Thunder rolled
and crashed among the mountains, the
rain came down on the zinc roof with a
deafening roar, the paths were foaming
water-courses, the water-courses boiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
rivers; and now and then a furious blast
shook the house to its foundation.</p>

<p>At last the laughing and talking
ceased, the merry company had departed.
She saw their lanterns dimly through
the mist, and instantly rushed into the
drawing-room. Betty was there, busily
putting away cards and counters, and
George, who had been speeding his guests,
stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>In her furious precipitation, Belle
knocked over a chair, and they both
turned and saw her—saw her livid, distorted
face, compressed lips and glittering
eyes—that looked as if they were illuminated
by some inward flame—and knew
but too well what these signs portended.</p>

<p>“So,” she screamed, her piercing voice
distinct above the thundering rain. “So
I have found you both out at last!
Oh! you false wretch,” shaking her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
photograph at Betty, “how I would like
to strangle you! You, that we all
thought so quiet, so modest, and that
was engaged all the time on the sly.
You artful, bad girl, you robbed me—<i>me</i>—of
his affections,” pointing to George.
“He liked me first, he liked me best.
He dares not deny it! I must say this
for him, that whatever he is, he is no
liar.”</p>

<p>All the time she was speaking—screaming,
it might be called—she was
tearing the photograph into atoms, with
feverish, frenzied fingers, and with the
word <i>liar</i>, she dashed them into Betty’s
face.</p>

<p>“Belle,” said her husband sternly,
“what are you about? Have you taken
leave of your senses? What do you
mean by treating your cousin in this
way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“There,” she shrieked, “there, you
take her part. You try and blind me
still! Have I gone out of my senses?
No, but I am <i>going</i> out of them! I
have opened your box, I have read my
mother’s letter. I know all. How dared
you marry me?”</p>

<p>After this question, there was a pause
for ten seconds, the rain and wind alone
broke the silence, whilst the raging
woman, from whom every restraint had
fallen away, awaited his answer.</p>

<p>“I married you,” speaking with painful
slowness, “because I thought it was
the only thing to be done under the
circumstances. I did my best to make
you happy, I hoped——”</p>

<p>“Hoped! Thought!” she interrupted,
shaking from head to foot. “Who cares
what you hoped or thought?” And
then she broke into a torrent of passion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
in which scathing, scorching words
seemed to pour from her lips one over
the other, like a stream of lava. This,
to the couple who had been mercilessly
sacrificed for her advantage.</p>

<p>“Betty,” said George abruptly, “this
is no scene for you; go to your own
room.”</p>

<p>“To her room! go out of the house,
go <i>now</i>!” cried Belle, stamping her foot;
“now, this second, do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” interrupted her husband,
“not to-night, you could not turn a dog
out in such weather.”</p>

<p>“No, but I would turn out a snake, a
viper, a cobra.”</p>

<p>“You may be certain that Betty is
not anxious to trespass on your hospitality,
but she will stay as a favour, she
shall not go out on such a night, I will
not allow it,” he returned firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“Very well then, <i>I’ll</i> go! The Burns
will take me in. I refuse to remain
under the same roof with that girl for
another five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid, Belle, I will go,”
said Betty, who had been hitherto too
stunned to move or speak. “I will go
this moment. You are a cruel woman,
you have wronged both George and me,
and you will be sorry for all you have
said to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Belle’s voice drowned hers in furious
protestations to the contrary, and she
hastened away, threw on a waterproof,
and twisted a scarf round her head, whilst
George called for a syce and a lantern.</p>

<p>“Belle,” he said, as he re-entered,
putting on his top-coat, and his face
looked white and set. “This is about
the last straw! God knows that I have
done my best, or tried to do my best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
for you. After this we will live apart—apart
for ever.”</p>

<p>Before she had time to reply, he was
gone, he had quitted the room, and she
saw him and Betty go forth into the
sheets of rain, and the black surrounding
darkness, in the wake of a syce with an
oilskin cape over his head, and a lantern
in his hand. She watched the trio descend
the hill, till they and their flickering
light were lost to sight.</p>

<p>Then she went and sat down beside
the dying fire—feeling somewhat exhausted—and
assured herself that she had
done well, had acted as any other wife
of spirit would have done, but her fury
was abating and her confidence with it;
cold remorse began to whisper in her
ear, as she listened to the booming of
the thunder and the roaring of the rain;
they had nearly three miles to go by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the long road, and Betty was in her
evening dress and shoes! Of course
George did not care for Betty <i>now</i>;
even her distorted mind could not summon
the ghost of a charge against him.
She glanced over past months, with the
piercing eye of a jealous wife. No,
there was not a word or a glance, by
which she could arraign him.</p>

<p>He had got over it ages ago. Betty
would marry some wealthy man, and
George was <i>her</i> husband. She must forgive
them! At the end of half-an-hour’s
solitary meditation, during which she had
reckoned up her probable allowance and
probable prospects at home, she actually
had absolved them both. Betty had no
business to have had an understanding
with George when she was a mere child—and
of course did not know her own
mind; but Betty had always been good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to her, forbearing, generous, and useful.
Only that very morning she had cooked
her a dainty little dish to tempt her
appetite, and she had gone down in all
the rain to get her a remedy for her
cold, and a novel from the library.</p>

<p>And George? yes, he was good to her
too; he never refused her money, he
never flirted with other women, he
always remembered her birthday, he
wrote regularly when she was from home,
and punctually met her at the station on
her return. If he was cold and reserved,
and hated French poodles, it was his
nature, and he could not help himself.
Looking round among the Lords and
Masters of her numerous acquaintances,
she could not name a woman who had
a better husband than her own.</p>

<p>And supposing he had really meant
what he said? There was a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
expression in his eyes,—a look that she
had never seen there before, not even
after she threw the tennis-bat at Mrs.
Monkton! And once, in a passion,
another lady told her that she wondered
Mr. Holroyd did not get a divorce
for incompatibility of temper! But no,
no; nothing but death should ever part
them. Her Australian trip had shown
her one thing most distinctly—that alone,
and unprotected by her popular, gentlemanly
husband, she was a very helpless
and insignificant little person. What was
she to do? Perhaps he would never
come back! The bare idea filled her
with dismay. She was now all penitence
(as usual). She would follow them
instantly to Mr. Redmond’s door. She
would make it up; she would abase herself;
she would go by the short cut
across the hill, and be there almost as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
soon as they were! No sooner thought
than done. She ran into her room, and
put on a cloak, and a pair of strong
shoes, and going into the back verandah,
called imperatively for a lamp and a
guide.</p>

<p>But what hill servant, sleeping comfortably
in his “comlee,” would respond
to the screams of a bad memsahib—demanding
a light and attendant, at one
o’clock, and on such a night? As she
had sowed, she reaped. No answer came,
not a sound, not a sign, from the cluster
of godowns at the back; for once she
refrained from rousing them in person.
She had no time to lose. She was
obliged to hunt up a lantern, and to
light and carry it herself; and with
“Mossoo” for her sole escort, she set
forth in the streaming downpour, and
started rapidly up the hill.</p>

<p>Betty almost ran down the footpath, her
feet shod with indignation, and refused
her companion’s proffered arm with a
sharp gesture, that was nearer akin to
passion than politeness. At first she hurried
along bravely enough, but afterwards
more slowly and painfully. What are
bronze shoes, and silk stockings, among
rocks and broken branches, and overflowing
water-courses? One of her feet
was badly cut, her hair had been blown
adrift by the stormy rain that beat her and
buffeted her so mercilessly. At last she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
was compelled to cling to the arm she had
previously scorned; for as she stumbled
forward in the wake of the blinking lantern
and shivering syce, furious gusts of
wind came sweeping down between Cheena
and Diopatha, and threatened to carry
her off her balance, and to extinguish
the light. The pair made no attempt to
speak, for their voices would have been
lost amid the crash of the thunder, and
the hollow roar of the torrents, as they
tumbled tumultuously down the ravines,
and poured into the lake with the noise
of an explosion. Amid the unchanging
fury of the storm, there were intervals of
blinding light, alternating with spells of
utter darkness. Once, in a comparatively
sheltered spot, Betty halted to twist up
her hair. As she did so, a dazzling
white flash lit up the dark surrounding
hills—the grey sheets of rain pattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
into the lake—the streaming path—themselves.</p>

<p>There was a momentary lull, as if the
raving, screaming wind was taking breath,
and Betty said tremulously, but with
perfect distinctness:</p>

<p>“George, to-night it must be <i>good-bye</i>
between us; you will understand that it
cannot be otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he returned hoarsely, “I could
never ask you to run the risk of such
another scene. It must be as you say—God
help us!”</p>

<p>A second flash, bright as day, illumined
his face; it was ashen; and in the haggard
eyes so near to hers there was a look of
wistfulness and despair—such an agonised
look, as the eyes of the dying wear when
they take leave of those they love best,
and pass away, alone, into that undiscovered
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>In a moment all was black again, and
once more the pair resumed that struggle
onwards, arm in arm, staggering against
the wind, and wrapped in the darkness
and the silence of their own thoughts.
After half an hour’s scrambling and groping,
and climbing of slippery paths that
ran with water, bruised, drenched, beaten
and breathless, they arrived at their destination,
and were vociferously announced
by the barking of half a dozen curs of
high and low degree.</p>

<p>Mr. Redmond always retired late, and
was still sitting up; reading—no—not a
treatise on jurisprudence, but a French
novel; he came in his dressing-gown and
spectacles, and opened the door in person,
and beheld his niece in a soaking evening
dress, bareheaded, and almost barefoot;
and Holroyd looking ghastly, with the
rain pouring off his cap and moustache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“What—what does this mean?” he
demanded in a voice in which anger and
amazement struggled for mastery. “Do
you wish to murder the girl—sir—that
you bring her out in such a plight on
such a night?”</p>

<p>“I am more sorry than I can say, but
I could not help it—I——”</p>

<p>“Come in, come in, man alive! and
don’t stand dripping there, come in and
explain yourself!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Bernard,” said Betty, taking off
her cloak and throwing back her wringing
hair. “He cannot explain—Belle and I
have had a quarrel.”</p>

<p>“A quarrel about what?” turning the
lamp full on her colourless face. Dead silence.</p>

<p>“There has been more than a quarrel!
There is something in the background.
Holroyd, you don’t leave my house till you
explain the whole business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, do not keep him,” expostulated
Betty. “Don’t you see how wet
he is?”</p>

<p>“Then <i>you</i> shall tell me, run away at
once, and put on dry clothes. I shall not
go to bed till I have come to the bottom
of this affair! What will every one say
when they hear that your cousin turned
you out of doors in the middle of such
a night? Holroyd, in common Christian
charity I must give you something to
drink. I don’t want to have your death
on my head, but mind you, I have not
done with you. Have some old brandy,
neat?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, I must go,” and he
glanced at Betty.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, approaching him
quickly as she spoke. “You must forgive
Belle; she will be very sorry; forgive
her as a favour to <i>me</i>. Remember,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
added, almost in a whisper, “what you
promised me last Christmas. <i>Good-bye</i>.”
Her lips trembled, whilst her eyes dismissed
him.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he echoed, in a husky
voice, wringing her hand as he spoke.
In another second he was gone—gone
without a word or glance towards Mr.
Redmond, and was hurrying down the
hill at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>“Must I tell you, Uncle Bernard?” said
Betty, when, after a short interval, she
returned to the sitting-room, in a long,
white, woollen gown, and with her hair
hanging over her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Yes, you must tell me everything,
and you must drink this cherry brandy.”</p>

<p>“I would so much rather not do one
or the other.”</p>

<p>“And you will have to do <i>both</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then, Uncle Bernard, remember you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
make me tell what I have never told to
a soul,” and her eyes flashed at him
through tears of passionate pain. “But
you stand in the place of my father.”</p>

<p>“I do, and you stand to me in the
place of a daughter. Begin what you
have to say—at once.”</p>

<p>“I—I—how can I begin?” she said,
shading her face with her hands. “I
knew George Holroyd very well three
years ago. I was a good deal at Bridgetstown
with his mother and sister, and—and—”
she hesitated.</p>

<p>“And he made love to you,” continued
her uncle bluntly.</p>

<p>“He could not marry, for he had no
money; he was supporting his mother
and sister, and he had but little besides
his pay.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised he did not ask you
to share <i>that</i>!” sneered her listener.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, he would not bind me to
any promise, but he said that if his
prospects improved—he would write.”</p>

<p>“And he never did. Oh, oh—I see
it all!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he wrote and enclosed the letter
to Mrs. Redmond, but Mrs. Redmond
wanted him to marry her own daughter.
She scratched out my name—and gave
the letter to Belle.”</p>

<p>“What!” shouted Mr. Redmond, rising
to his feet, “what madwoman’s nonsense
is this?”</p>

<p>“It is true: the letter seemed to apply
to either of us. Belle thought he liked
her—she hated Noone, she was glad to
get away from it—at any price,” she
gasped, in short and breathless sentences.</p>

<p>“And <i>you</i> paid the price?”</p>

<p>To this question Betty gave no answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
or sign, beyond a slight quivering of
the lips.</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” continued the Collector
imperiously.</p>

<p>“I never knew the truth, until Mrs.
Redmond was dying, and then she told
me all. Belle went out to Bombay in
complete ignorance, and George met her,
and married her.”</p>

<p>“The fool! the maniac! the great
idiot!” cried Mr. Redmond, throwing up
his hands. “He must have been out of
his mind.”</p>

<p>“He believed that he was acting for
the best,” said Betty with a kind of proud
severity, “and I think he did right; what
would have become of Belle, destitute and
friendless? He has always kept his secret
till now, but she opened his dispatch box,
and read her mother’s letter; she never
had a suspicion of the truth till to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“And the effect of her discovery?”</p>

<p>“Was to turn me instantly out of her
house, but I know she will be sorry to-morrow—she
always is.”</p>

<p>“Well—well—well,” turning about and
pacing the room, with his hands clasped
behind him under his dressing-gown. “I
am fifty years of age, and this story—this
extraordinary story—transcends everything
in my experience either at home or
abroad. Poor Holroyd, unfortunate devil!
Betty, you will never cross her threshold,
and never speak a word to that termagant
again.”</p>

<p>“No, nor to him either, uncle; we
agreed to-night that we would be strangers
for the future.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ha, hum,” stroking his chin;
“well I daresay you are right, you can’t
cut a woman and know her husband.”</p>

<p>“And now, Uncle Bernard, I am so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
very, very tired, you will let me go,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>She looked haggard and completely
exhausted, her face was as white as her
gown.</p>

<p>The horror and shame of Belle’s outbreak,
that terrible walk through rain and
darkness, the ordeal of having to lay bare
her secret to her uncle, had been too much,
even for her fortitude.</p>

<p>“Come and kiss me, Betty. I declare
you are a good girl, you are a true Redmond,
and have a fine moral backbone.
Poor Betty, you have had a hard part to
play.”</p>

<p>She approached and laid her lips softly
on his forehead—lips that were icy cold;
she was so grave, and pale, and so utterly
unlike herself, that her uncle was slightly
awed, and suffered her to depart in
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Redmond still sat up, and actually
lit a cigar to soothe his ruffled feelings,
and to re-arrange his thoughts.</p>

<p>“That old Redmond woman ought to
have been transported. Supposing Betty
had got the letter all right, and come
out and married Holroyd? Well, he liked
him, he used to be a capital fellow, but
as it was, Betty could do far better, and
marry someone in his own service.”</p>

<p>Poor Holroyd! he had made him his
confidante about Hammond too. Yes,
that was certainly an awkward mistake.
It could not be possible that Betty had
still—no—no, out of the question. However,
she was a sensible girl, they had
better be strangers in future, but he himself
was not going to give up George’s
acquaintance (man-like, he considered that
a woman could easily make sacrifices that
were disagreeable and unnecessary for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
him). They could still meet and dine
at the club; they could go out shooting
together. As to George’s wife, to relinquish
<i>her</i> society was no hardship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain Holroyd was re-turning
homewards with headlong speed;
he had now no girl companion to guide
and protect, and as for himself, he did
not care. At first he determined to go to
an hotel, or the club, for the remainder of
the night, but on second thoughts, he
changed his mind. He had never been
one to send the family linen to the public
wash. He would endure to the end—and
this was almost the end. It required a
man with a more hopeful buoyant nature
than his to resist sinking under the
weight of his surroundings. He would
abandon the struggle once for all. The life
he led was not the existence of a self-respecting
human being—it was the life of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
dog. He would offer Belle a tempting
allowance, leaving himself just sufficient for
bare necessaries; he would tell her that
he could endure her society no longer, and
that she must accept it, and go—go home.
If not, if she made a scandal, as she had
once threatened, he would sell out, and
join some exploring party in Africa,
Australia, or Central America. Part they
must; he was past the days of piteous
protestations, caresses, and hysterics, and
he was about to shape the rest of his life
in another form. Belle and her mother
had ruined his happiness; he was an embittered,
disheartened, truly miserable man.
All his best friends could give him was
pity and sympathy. As to what “might
have been,” he dared not trust himself to
glance at it. He would free himself from
Belle, and put half the world between
himself and Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>With this stern resolution in his mind,
he found himself once more at home—the
door stood wide open, the lamp was flaring
in the drawing-room, and that apartment
was precisely as he had left it—with
the overturned chair, and torn photograph,
lying on the ground—but empty.
Where was Belle? The house seemed
unnaturally quiet; he looked into her bedroom,
a pair of slippers lay in the middle
of the floor, as if they had been hastily
kicked off. He called; there was no
reply; he searched, he took the lantern
and went outside; the rain was abating,
for it was near dawn. He held the light
close to the ground, and saw the fresh
footprints of two small shoes; they went
up the hill, not down. In an instant the
truth flashed upon him. In a fit of remorse,
Belle had followed them and gone
by the short cut—the “closed” road.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
He seized the lantern, now burning very
faintly, and started at once in pursuit;
for more than a mile he followed the
pathway, now ascending, now descending,
sometimes between rocks, sometimes between
trees, sometimes along the bare
edge of a sheer naked precipice; and then
the light went out, but as a faint grey
glimmer came creeping through the mists,
he was able to make his way on at a steady
pace, though his heart thumped loudly
against his ribs, and his nerves were strung
to their utmost tension, for a chill shadow
of apprehension seemed to stalk beside
him! Suddenly, turning a sharp corner,
he was brought to a standstill, by a
ghastly break in the narrow track. The
hill above had slipped down five hundred
feet, carrying with it, rocks, trees and
pathway; loose showers of little stones
were still trickling lakewards, and as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
dawn came stealing over the crest of
Cheena, and penetrated through the dispersing
clouds, George was aware of a
small object, a dog—shivering miserably
on the brink of the gaping chasm,
or running to and fro, with every token
of anguish and despair.</p>

<p>Belle’s wish had been accomplished.
“Mossoo” survived her.</p>
